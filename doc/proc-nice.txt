|proc_nice| changes the priority of the current process by the amount
specified in {increment}. A positive {increment} will lower the priority of
the current process, whereas a negative {increment} will raise the priority.

|proc_nice| is not related to |proc_open| and its associated functions in any
way.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure. If an error occurs, like the user
lacks permission to change the priority, an error of level E_WARNING is also
generated.
