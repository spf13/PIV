runkit_lint_file -- Check the PHP syntax of the specified file

  bool runkit_lint_file(string filename)~

The |runkit_lint_file| function performs a syntax (lint) check on the
specified filename testing for scripting errors. This is similar to using php
-l from the commandline.

Sandbox support (required for |runkit_lint|, |runkit_lint_file|, and the
Runkit_Sandbox class) is only available as of PHP 5.1.0 or specially patched
versions of PHP 5.0, and requires that thread safety be enabled. See the
README file included in the runkit package for more information.

{filename} File containing PHP Code to be lint checked

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
