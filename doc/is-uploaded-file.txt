is_uploaded_file -- Tells whether the file was uploaded via HTTP POST

  bool is_uploaded_file(string filename)~

Returns TRUE if the file named by {filename} was uploaded via HTTP POST. This
is useful to help ensure that a malicious user hasn't tried to trick the
script into working on files upon which it should not be working--for
instance, /etc/passwd.

This sort of check is especially important if there is any chance that
anything done with uploaded files could reveal their contents to the user, or
even to other users on the same system.

For proper working, the function |is_uploaded_file| needs an argument like
$_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name'], - the name of the uploaded file on the
clients machine $_FILES['userfile']['name'] does not work.

{filename} The filename being checked.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

<?php >
  if (is_uploaded_file($_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name'])) {
     echo "File ". $_FILES['userfile']['name'] ." uploaded successfully.\n";
     echo "Displaying contents\n";
     readfile($_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name']);
  } else {
     echo "Possible file upload attack: ";
     echo "filename '". $_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name'] . "'.";
  }
?>
