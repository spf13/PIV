mb_strcut -- Get part of string

  string mb_strcut(string str, int start [, int length [, string encoding]])~

|mb_strcut| performs equivalent operation as |mb_substr| with different
method. If {start} position is multi-byte character's second byte or larger,
it starts from first byte of multi-byte character.

It subtracts string from {str} that is shorter than {length} AND character
that is not part of multi-byte string or not being middle of shift sequence.

{str} The string being cut.

{start} The position that begins the cut.

{length} The string being decoded.

{encoding} The {encoding} parameter is the character encoding. If it is
omitted, the internal character encoding value will be used.

|mb_strcut| returns the portion of {str} specified by the {start} and {length}
parameters.

|mb_substr| |mb_internal_encoding|
