header -- Send a raw HTTP header

  void header(string string [, bool replace [, int http_response_code]])~

|header| is used to send a raw HTTP header. See the HTTP/1.1 specification for
more information on HTTP headers.

Remember that |header| must be called before any actual output is sent, either
by normal HTML tags, blank lines in a file, or from PHP. It is a very common
error to read code with |include|, or |require|, functions, or another file
access function, and have spaces or empty lines that are output before
|header| is called. The same problem exists when using a single PHP/HTML file.

  <html>
<?php >
  /* This will give an error. Note the output
   * above, which is before the header() call */
  header('Location: http://www.example.com/');
?>

{string} The header string.

There are two special-case header calls. The first is a header that starts
with the string "HTTP/" (case is not significant), which will be used to
figure out the HTTP status code to send. For example, if you have configured
Apache to use a PHP script to handle requests for missing files (using the
ErrorDocument directive), you may want to make sure that your script generates
the proper status code.

<?php >
  header("HTTP/1.0 404 Not Found");
?>

The second special case is the "Location:" header. Not only does it send this
header back to the browser, but it also returns a REDIRECT (302) status code
to the browser unless some 3xx status code has already been set.

<?php >
  header("Location: http://www.example.com/"); /* Redirect browser */
  
  /* Make sure that code below does not get executed when we redirect. */
  exit;
?>

{replace} The optional {replace} parameter indicates whether the header should
replace a previous similar header, or add a second header of the same type. By
default it will replace, but if you pass in FALSE as the second argument you
can force multiple headers of the same type. For example:

<?php >
  header('WWW-Authenticate: Negotiate');
  header('WWW-Authenticate: NTLM', false);
?>

{http_response_code} Forces the HTTP response code to the specified value.

No value is returned.

Version Description 4.4.2 and 5.1.2 This function now prevents more than one
header to be sent at once as a protection against header injection attacks.
4.3.0 The {http_response_code} parameter was added. 4.0.4 The {replace}
parameter was added.

Download dialog If you want the user to be prompted to save the data you are
sending, such as a generated PDF file, you can use the Content-Disposition
header to supply a recommended filename and force the browser to display the
save dialog.

<?php >
  // We'll be outputting a PDF
  header('Content-type: application/pdf');
  
  // It will be called downloaded.pdf
  header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="downloaded.pdf"');
  
  // The PDF source is in original.pdf
  readfile('original.pdf');
?>



Caching directives PHP scripts often generate dynamic content that must not be
cached by the client browser or any proxy caches between the server and the
client browser. Many proxies and clients can be forced to disable caching
with:

<?php >
  header("Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate"); // HTTP/1.1
  header("Expires: Sat, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT"); // Date in the past
?>

You may find that your pages aren't cached even if you don't output all of the
headers above. There are a number of options that users may be able to set for
their browser that change its default caching behavior. By sending the headers
above, you should override any settings that may otherwise cause the output of
your script to be cached.

Additionally, |session_cache_limiter| and the session.cache_limiter
configuration setting can be used to automatically generate the correct
caching-related headers when sessions are being used.





As of PHP 4, you can use output buffering to get around this problem, with the
overhead of all of your output to the browser being buffered in the server
until you send it. You can do this by calling |ob_start| and |ob_end_flush| in
your script, or setting the output_buffering configuration directive on in
your php.ini or server configuration files.

The HTTP status header line will always be the first sent to the client,
regardless of the actual |header| call being the first or not. The status may
be overridden by calling |header| with a new status line at any time unless
the HTTP headers have already been sent.

There is a bug in Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.01 that prevents this from
working. There is no workaround. There is also a bug in Microsoft Internet
Explorer 5.5 that interferes with this, which can be resolved by upgrading to
Service Pack 2 or later.

If safe mode is enabled the uid of the script is added to the realm part of
the WWW-Authenticate header if you set this header (used for HTTP
Authentication).

HTTP/1.1 requires an absolute URI as argument to Location: including the
scheme, hostname and absolute path, but some clients accept relative URIs. You
can usually use $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'], $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] and |dirname| to
make an absolute URI from a relative one yourself:

<?php >
  /* Redirect to a different page in the current directory that was requested */
  $host  = $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'];
  $uri   = rtrim(dirname($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']), '/\\');
  $extra = 'mypage.php';
  header("Location: http://$host$uri/$extra");
  exit;
?>

Session ID is not passed with Location header even if session.use_trans_sid is
enabled. It must by passed manually using SID constant.
