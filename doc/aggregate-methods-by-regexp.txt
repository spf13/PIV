aggregate_methods_by_regexp -- Selective class methods aggregation to an
object using a regular expression

  void aggregate_methods_by_regexp(object object, string class_name, string regexp [, bool exclude])~

Aggregates methods from a class to an existing object using a regular
expression to match method names.

The class constructor or methods whose names start with an underscore
character (_), which are considered private to the aggregated class, are
always excluded.

{object}

{class_name}

{regexp}

{exclude} The optional parameter {exclude} is used to decide whether the
regular expression will select the names of methods to include in the
aggregation (i.e. {exclude} is FALSE, which is the default value), or to
exclude from the aggregation ({exclude} is TRUE).

No value is returned.
