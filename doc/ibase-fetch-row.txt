ibase_fetch_row -- Fetch a row from an InterBase database

  array ibase_fetch_row(resource result_identifier [, int fetch_flag])~

|ibase_fetch_row| fetches one row of data from the given result set.

Subsequent calls to |ibase_fetch_row| return the next row in the result set,
or FALSE if there are no more rows.

{result_identifier} An InterBase result identifier.

{fetch_flag} {fetch_flag} is a combination of the constants IBASE_TEXT and
IBASE_UNIXTIME ORed together. Passing IBASE_TEXT will cause this function to
return BLOB contents instead of BLOB ids. Passing IBASE_UNIXTIME will cause
this function to return date/time values as Unix timestamps instead of as
formatted strings.

Returns an array that corresponds to the fetched row, or FALSE if there are no
more rows. Each result column is stored in an array offset, starting at offset
0.

|ibase_fetch_assoc| |ibase_fetch_object|
