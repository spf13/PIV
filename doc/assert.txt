assert -- Checks if assertion is FALSE

  bool assert(mixed assertion)~

|assert| will check the given {assertion} and take appropriate action if its
result is FALSE.

If the {assertion} is given as a string it will be evaluated as PHP code by
|assert|. The advantages of a string {assertion} are less overhead when
assertion checking is off and messages containing the {assertion} expression
when an assertion fails. This means that if you pass a boolean condition as
{assertion} this condition will not show up as parameter to the assertion
function which you may have defined with the |assert_options| function, the
condition is converted to a string before calling that handler function, and
the boolean FALSE is converted as the empty string.

Assertions should be used as a debugging feature only. You may use them for
sanity-checks that test for conditions that should always be TRUE and that
indicate some programming errors if not or to check for the presence of
certain features like extension functions or certain system limits and
features.

Assertions should not be used for normal runtime operations like input
parameter checks. As a rule of thumb your code should always be able to work
correctly if assertion checking is not activated.

The behavior of |assert| may be configured by |assert_options| or by
.ini-settings described in that functions manual page.

The |assert_options| function and/or ASSERT_CALLBACK configuration directive
allow a callback function to be set to handle failed assertions.

|assert| callbacks are particularly useful for building automated test suites
because they allow you to easily capture the code passed to the assertion,
along with information on where the assertion was made. While this information
can be captured via other methods, using assertions makes it much faster and
easier!

The callback function should accept three arguments. The first argument will
contain the file the assertion failed in. The second argument will contain the
line the assertion failed on and the third argument will contain the
expression that failed (if any - literal values such as 1 or "two" will not be
passed via this argument)

{assertion} The assertion.

FALSE if the assertion is false, TRUE otherwise.

Handle a failed assertion with a custom handler

<?php >
  // Active assert and make it quiet
  assert_options(ASSERT_ACTIVE, 1);
  assert_options(ASSERT_WARNING, 0);
  assert_options(ASSERT_QUIET_EVAL, 1);
  
  // Create a handler function
  function my_assert_handler($file, $line, $code)
  {
      echo "<hr>Assertion Failed:
          File '$file'<br />
          Line '$line'<br />
          Code '$code'<br /><hr />";
  }
  
  // Set up the callback
  assert_options(ASSERT_CALLBACK, 'my_assert_handler');
  
  // Make an assertion that should fail
  assert('mysql_query("")');
?>
