com_print_typeinfo -- Print out a PHP class definition for a dispatchable
interface

  bool com_print_typeinfo(object comobject [, string dispinterface [, bool wantsink]])~

The purpose of this function is to help generate a skeleton class for use as
an event sink. You may also use it to generate a dump of any COM object,
provided that it supports enough of the introspection interfaces, and that you
know the name of the interface you want to display.

{comobject} {comobject} should be either an instance of a COM object, or be
the name of a typelibrary (which will be resolved according to the rules set
out in |com_load_typelib|).

{dispinterface} The name of an IDispatch descendant interface that you want to
display.

{wantsink} If set to TRUE, the corresponding sink interface will be displayed
instead.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
