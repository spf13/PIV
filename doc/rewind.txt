rewind -- Rewind the position of a file pointer

  bool rewind(resource handle)~

Sets the file position indicator for {handle} to the beginning of the file
stream.

If you have opened the file in append ("a" or "a+") mode, any data you write
to the file will always be appended, regardless of the file position.

{handle} The file pointer must be valid, and must point to a file successfully
opened by |fopen|.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

|rewind| overwriting example

<?php >
  $handle = fopen('output.txt', 'r+');
  
  fwrite($handle, 'Really long sentence.');
  rewind($handle);
  fwrite($handle, 'Foo');
  rewind($handle);
  
  echo fread($handle, filesize('output.txt'));
  
  fclose($handle);
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  Foolly long sentence.
