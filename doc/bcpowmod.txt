bcpowmod -- Raise an arbitrary precision number to another, reduced by a
specified modulus

  string bcpowmod(string left_operand, string right_operand, string modulus [, int scale])~

Use the fast-exponentiation method to raise {left_operand} to the power
{right_operand} with respect to the modulus {modulus}.

{left_operand} The left operand, as a string.

{right_operand} The right operand, as a string.

{modulus} The modulus, as a string.

{ scale}This optional parameter is used to set the number of digits after the
decimal place in the result. You can also set the global default scale for all
functions by using |bcscale|.

Returns the result as a string, or NULL if {modulus} is 0.

Because this method uses the modulus operation, non-natural numbers may give
unexpected results. A natural number is any positive non-zero integer.

The following two statements are functionally identical. The |bcpowmod|
version however, executes in less time and can accept larger parameters.

<?php >
  $a = bcpowmod($x, $y, $mod);
  
  $b = bcmod(bcpow($x, $y), $mod);
  
  // $a and $b are equal to each other.
?>

|bcpow| |bcmod|
