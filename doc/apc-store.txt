apc_store -- Cache a variable in the data store

  bool apc_store(string key, mixed var [, int ttl])~

Cache a variable in the data store.

Unlike many other mechanisms in PHP, variables stored using |apc_store| will
persist between requests (until the value is removed from the cache).

{key} Store the variable using this name. {key}s are cache-unique, so storing
a second value with the same {key} will overwrite the original value.

{var} The variable to store

{ttl} Time To Live; store {var} in the cache for {ttl} seconds. After the
{ttl} has passed, the stored variable will be expunged from the cache (on the
next request). If no {ttl} is supplied (or if the {ttl} is 0), the value will
persist until it is removed from the cache manually, or otherwise fails to
exist in the cache (clear, restart, etc.).

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

A |apc_store| example

<?php >
  $bar = 'BAR';
  apc_store('foo', $bar);
  var_dump(apc_fetch('foo'));
?>

The above example will output:

  string(3) "BAR"
