xdiff_file_diff -- Make unified diff of two files

  bool xdiff_file_diff(string old_file, string new_file, string dest [, int context [, bool minimal]])~

Makes an unified diff containing differences between {old_file} and {new_file}
and stores it in {dest} file. The resulting file is human-readable. An
optional {context} parameter specifies how many lines of context should be
added around each change (with default value of 3). Setting {minimal}
parameter to true will result in outputting the shortest patch file possible
(can take a long time).

{old_file} Path to the first file. This file acts as "old" file.

{new_file} Path to the second file. This file acts as "new" file.

{dest} Path of the resulting patch file.

{context} Indicates how many lines of context you want to include in diff
result. Default is 3.

{minimal} Set this parameter to TRUE if you want to minimalize size of the
result (can take a long time).

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

|xdiff_file_diff| example The following code makes unified diff of two php
files with context length of 2.

<?php >
  $old_version = 'my_script.php';
  $new_version = 'my_new_script.php';
  
  xdiff_file_diff($old_version, $new_version, 'my_script.diff', 2);
?>



This function doesn't work well with binary files. To make diff of binary
files use |xdiff_file_bdiff|/|xdiff_file_rabdiff| function.
