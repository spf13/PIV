mssql_free_result -- Free result memory

  bool mssql_free_result(resource result)~

|mssql_free_result| only needs to be called if you are worried about using too
much memory while your script is running. All result memory will automatically
be freed when the script ends. You may call |mssql_free_result| with the
result identifier as an argument and the associated result memory will be
freed.

{result} The result resource that is being freed. This result comes from a
call to |mssql_query|.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

|mssql_free_result| example

<?php >
  // Select some data from a table
  $query = mssql_query('SELECT * FROM [php].[dbo].[persons]', $link);
  
  // Handle query result here
  
  // When we're done we free the result by calling
  // mssql_free_result like so:
  mssql_free_result($query);
