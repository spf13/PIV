imagecolortransparent -- Define a color as transparent

  int imagecolortransparent(resource image [, int color])~

Sets the transparent color in the given {image}.

{ image}An image resource, returned by one of the image creation functions,
such as |imagecreatetruecolor|.

{color} A color identifier created with |imagecolorallocate|.

The identifier of the new (or current, if none is specified) transparent color
is returned.

|imagecolortransparent| example

<?php >
  // Create a 55x30 image
  $im = imagecreatetruecolor(55, 30);
  $red = imagecolorallocate($im, 255, 0, 0);
  $black = imagecolorallocate($im, 0, 0, 0);
  
  // Make the background transparent
  imagecolortransparent($im, $black);
  
  // Draw a red rectangle
  imagefilledrectangle($im, 4, 4, 50, 25, $red);
  
  // Save the image
  imagepng($im, './imagecolortransparent.png');
  imagedestroy($im);
?>

The above example will output something similar to:



Transparency is copied only with |imagecopymerge| and true color images, not
with |imagecopy| or pallete images.

The transparent color is a property of the image, transparency is not a
property of the color. Once you have set a color to be the transparent color,
any regions of the image in that color that were drawn previously will be
transparent.
