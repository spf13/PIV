ob_end_clean -- Clean (erase) the output buffer and turn off output buffering

  bool ob_end_clean()~

This function discards the contents of the topmost output buffer and turns off
this output buffering. If you want to further process the buffer's contents
you have to call |ob_get_contents| before |ob_end_clean| as the buffer
contents are discarded when |ob_end_clean| is called.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure. Reasons for failure are first
that you called the function without an active buffer or that for some reason
a buffer could not be deleted (possible for special buffer).

If the function fails it generates an E_NOTICE.

Version Description 4.2.0 The boolean return value was added.

The following example shows an easy way to get rid of all output buffers:

|ob_end_clean| example

<?php >
  ob_start();
  echo 'Text that won\'t get displayed.';
  ob_end_clean();
?>





|ob_start| |ob_get_contents| |ob_flush|
