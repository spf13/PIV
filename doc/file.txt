file -- Reads entire file into an array

  array file(string filename [, int flags [, resource context]])~

Reads an entire file into an array.

You can use |file_get_contents| to return the contents of a file as a string.

{filename} Path to the file.

A URL can be used as a filename with this function if the fopen wrappers have
been enabled. See |fopen| for more details on how to specify the filename and
for a list of supported URL protocols.

{flags} The optional parameter {flags} can be one, or more, of the following
constants: FILE_USE_INCLUDE_PATH Search for the file in the include_path.

FILE_IGNORE_NEW_LINES Do not add newline at the end of each array element

FILE_SKIP_EMPTY_LINES Skip empty lines

FILE_TEXT The content is returned in UTF-8 encoding. You can specify a
different encoding by creating a custom context. This flag cannot be used with
FILE_BINARY.

FILE_BINARY The content is read as binary data. This is the default setting
and cannot be used with FILE_TEXT.

{context} A context resource created with the |stream_context_create|
function.

Context support was added with PHP 5.0.0. For a description of contexts, refer
to .



Returns the file in an array. Each element of the array corresponds to a line
in the file, with the newline still attached. Upon failure, |file| returns
FALSE.

Each line in the resulting array will include the line ending, unless
FILE_IGNORE_NEW_LINES is used, so you still need to use |rtrim| if you do not
want the line ending present.

If PHP is not properly recognizing the line endings when reading files either
on or created by a Macintosh computer, enabling the auto_detect_line_endings
run-time configuration option may help resolve the problem.

Version Description 6.0.0 Added support for the FILE_TEXT and FILE_BINARY
flags. For forward compatibility, these constants are available as of PHP
5.2.7

5.0.0 The {context} parameter was added 5.0.0 Prior to PHP 5.0.0 the {flags}
parameter only covered include_path and was enabled with 1 4.3.0 |file| became
binary safe

|file| example

<?php >
  // Get a file into an array.  In this example we'll go through HTTP to get
  // the HTML source of a URL.
  $lines = file('http://www.example.com/');
  
  // Loop through our array, show HTML source as HTML source; and line numbers too.
  foreach ($lines as $line_num => $line) {
      echo "Line #<b>{$line_num}</b> : " . htmlspecialchars($line) . "<br />\n";
  }
  
  // Another example, let's get a web page into a string.  See also file_get_contents().
  $html = implode('', file('http://www.example.com/'));
  
  // Using the optional flags parameter since PHP 5
  $trimmed = file('somefile.txt', FILE_IGNORE_NEW_LINES | FILE_SKIP_EMPTY_LINES);
?>





When using SSL, Microsoft IIS will violate the protocol by closing the
connection without sending a close_notify indicator. PHP will report this as
"SSL: Fatal Protocol Error" when you reach the end of the data. To work around
this, the value of error_reporting should be lowered to a level that does not
include warnings. PHP 4.3.7 and higher can detect buggy IIS server software
when you open the stream using the https:// wrapper and will suppress the
warning. When using |fsockopen| to create an ssl:// socket, the developer is
responsible for detecting and suppressing this warning.
