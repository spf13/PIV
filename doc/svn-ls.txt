svn_ls -- Returns list of directory contents in repository URL, optionally at
revision number

  array svn_ls(string repos_url [, int revision_no [, bool recurse]])~

This function queries the repository URL and returns a list of files and
directories, optionally from a specific revision. This is equivalent to svn
list $repos_url[@$revision_no]

This function does not work with working copies. {repos_url} must be a
repository URL.

{url} URL of the repository, eg. http://www.example.com/svnroot. To access a
local Subversion repository via filesystem, use the file URI scheme, eg.
file:///home/user/svn-repos

{revision} Integer revision number to retrieve listing of. When omitted, the
HEAD revision is used.

{recurse} Enables recursion.

On success, this function returns an array file listing in the format of:

  [0] => Array
      (
          [created_rev] => integer revision number of last edit
          [last_author] => string author name of last edit
          [size] => integer byte file size of file
          [time] => string date of last edit in form 'M d H:i'
                    or 'M d Y', depending on how old the file is
          [time_t] => integer unix timestamp of last edit
          [name] => name of file/directory
          [type] => type, can be 'file' or 'dir'
      )
  [1] => ...



This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

|svn_ls| example

<?php >
  print_r( svn_ls('http://www.example.com/svnroot/') );
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  Array
  (
      [0] => Array
          (
              [created_rev] => 20
              [last_author] => Joe
              [size] => 0
              [time] => Apr 02 09:28
              [time_t] => 1175520529
              [name] => tags
              [type] => dir
          )
      [1] => Array
          (
              [created_rev] => 23
              [last_author] => Bob
              [size] => 0
              [time] => Apr 02 15:15
              [time_t] => 1175541322
              [name] => trunk
              [type] => dir
          )
  )
