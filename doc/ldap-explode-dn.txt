ldap_explode_dn -- Splits DN into its component parts

  array ldap_explode_dn(string dn, int with_attrib)~

Splits the DN returned by |ldap_get_dn| and breaks it up into its component
parts. Each part is known as Relative Distinguished Name, or RDN.

{dn} The distinguished name of an LDAP entity.

{with_attrib} Used to request if the RDNs are returned with only values or
their attributes as well. To get RDNs with the attributes (i.e. in
attribute=value format) set {with_attrib} to 0 and to get only values set it
to 1.

Returns an array of all DN components. The first element in this array has
count key and represents the number of returned values, next elements are
numerically indexed DN components.
