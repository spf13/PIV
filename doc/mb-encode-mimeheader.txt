mb_encode_mimeheader -- Encode string for MIME header

  string mb_encode_mimeheader(string str [, string charset [, string transfer_encoding [, string linefeed [, int indent]]]])~

Encodes a given string {str} by the MIME header encoding scheme.

{str} The string being encoded.

{charset} {charset} specifies the name of the character set in which {str} is
represented in. The default value is determined by the current NLS setting
(mbstring.language). |mb_internal_encoding| should be set to same encoding.

{transfer_encoding} {transfer_encoding} specifies the scheme of MIME encoding.
It should be either "B" (Base64) or "Q" (Quoted-Printable). Falls back to "B"
if not given.

{linefeed} {linefeed} specifies the EOL (end-of-line) marker with which
|mb_encode_mimeheader| performs line-folding (a RFC term, the act of breaking
a line longer than a certain length into multiple lines. The length is
currently hard-coded to 74 characters). Falls back to "\r\n" (CRLF) if not
given.

{indent} Indentation of the first line (number of characters in the header
before {str}).

A converted version of the string represented in ASCII.

Version Description 5.0.0 The {indent} parameter was added.

|mb_encode_mimeheader| example

<?php >
  $name = ""; // kanji
  $mbox = "kru";
  $doma = "gtinn.mon";
  $addr = mb_encode_mimeheader($name, "UTF-7", "Q") . " <" . $mbox . "@" . $doma . ">";
  echo $addr;
?>





This function isn't designed to break lines at higher-level contextual break
points (word boundaries, etc.). This behaviour may clutter up the original
string with unexpected spaces.
