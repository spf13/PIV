mysql_ping -- Ping a server connection or reconnect if there is no connection

  bool mysql_ping([resource link_identifier])~

Checks whether or not the connection to the server is working. If it has gone
down, an automatic reconnection is attempted. This function can be used by
scripts that remain idle for a long while, to check whether or not the server
has closed the connection and reconnect if necessary.

Since MySQL 5.0.13, automatic reconnection feature is disabled.

{ link_identifier}The MySQL connection. If the link identifier is not
specified, the last link opened by |mysql_connect| is assumed. If no such link
is found, it will try to create one as if |mysql_connect| was called with no
arguments. If by chance no connection is found or established, an E_WARNING
level error is generated.

Returns TRUE if the connection to the server MySQL server is working,
otherwise FALSE.

A |mysql_ping| example

<?php >
  set_time_limit(0);
  
  $conn = mysql_connect('localhost', 'mysqluser', 'mypass');
  $db   = mysql_select_db('mydb');
  
  /* Assuming this query will take a long time */
  $result = mysql_query($sql);
  if (!$result) {
      echo 'Query #1 failed, exiting.';
      exit;
  }
  
  /* Make sure the connection is still alive, if not, try to reconnect */
  if (!mysql_ping($conn)) {
      echo 'Lost connection, exiting after query #1';
      exit;
  }
  mysql_free_result($result);
  
  /* So the connection is still alive, let's run another query */
  $result2 = mysql_query($sql2);
?>
