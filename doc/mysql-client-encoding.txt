mysql_client_encoding -- Returns the name of the character set

  string mysql_client_encoding([resource link_identifier])~

Retrieves the character_set variable from MySQL.

{ link_identifier}The MySQL connection. If the link identifier is not
specified, the last link opened by |mysql_connect| is assumed. If no such link
is found, it will try to create one as if |mysql_connect| was called with no
arguments. If by chance no connection is found or established, an E_WARNING
level error is generated.

Returns the default character set name for the current connection.

<?php >
  $link    = mysql_connect('localhost', 'mysql_user', 'mysql_password');
  $charset = mysql_client_encoding($link);
  
  echo "The current character set is: $charset\n";
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  The current character set is: latin1
