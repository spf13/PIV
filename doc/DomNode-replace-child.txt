DomNode->replace_child -- Replaces a child

  domelement DomNode->replace_child(domelement newnode, domelement oldnode)~

(PHP 4.2) This function replaces the child {oldnode} with the passed new node.
If the new node is already a child it will not be added a second time. If the
old node cannot be found the function returns FALSE. If the replacement
succeeds the old node is returned.

(PHP 4.3) This function replaces the child {oldnode} with the passed
{newnode}, even if the new node already is a child of the DomNode. If
{newnode} was already inserted in the document it is first unlinked from its
existing context. If the old node cannot be found the function returns FALSE.
If the replacement succeeds the old node is returned. (This behaviour is
according to the W3C specs).
