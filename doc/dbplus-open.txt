dbplus_open -- Open relation file

  resource dbplus_open(string name)~

Opens the given relation file.

{name} Can be either a file name or a relative or absolute path name. This
will be mapped in any case to an absolute relation file path on a specific
host machine and server.

On success a relation file resource (cursor) is returned which must be used in
any subsequent commands referencing the relation. Failure leads to a zero
return value, the actual error code may be asked for by calling
|dbplus_errno|.

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.
