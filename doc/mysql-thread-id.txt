mysql_thread_id -- Return the current thread ID

  int mysql_thread_id([resource link_identifier])~

Retrieves the current thread ID. If the connection is lost, and a reconnect
with |mysql_ping| is executed, the thread ID will change. This means only
retrieve the thread ID when needed.

{ link_identifier}The MySQL connection. If the link identifier is not
specified, the last link opened by |mysql_connect| is assumed. If no such link
is found, it will try to create one as if |mysql_connect| was called with no
arguments. If by chance no connection is found or established, an E_WARNING
level error is generated.

The thread ID on success, or FALSE on failure.

|mysql_thread_id| example

<?php >
  $link = mysql_connect('localhost', 'mysql_user', 'mysql_password');
  $thread_id = mysql_thread_id($link);
  if ($thread_id){
      printf("current thread id is %d\n", $thread_id);
  }
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  current thread id is 73



|mysql_ping| |mysql_list_processes|
