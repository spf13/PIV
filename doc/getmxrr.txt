getmxrr -- Get MX records corresponding to a given Internet host name

  bool getmxrr(string hostname, array mxhosts [, array weight])~

Searches DNS for MX records corresponding to {hostname}.

{hostname} The Internet host name.

{mxhosts} A list of the MX records found is placed into the array {mxhosts}.

{weight} If the {weight} array is given, it will be filled with the weight
information gathered.

Returns TRUE if any records are found; returns FALSE if no records were found
or if an error occurred.

Version Description 5.3.0 This function is now available on Windows platforms.

This function should not be used for the purposes of address verification.
Only the mailexchangers found in DNS are returned, however, according to RFC
2821 when no mail exchangers are listed, {hostname} itself should be used as
the only mail exchanger with a priority of 0.

For compatibility with Windows before this was implemented, then try the PEAR
class Net_DNS.
