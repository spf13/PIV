snmpwalkoid -- Query for a tree of information about a network entity

  array snmpwalkoid(string hostname, string community, string object_id [, int timeout [, int retries]])~

|snmpwalkoid| function is used to read all object ids and their respective
values from an SNMP agent specified by {hostname}.

The existence of |snmpwalkoid| and |snmpwalk| has historical reasons. Both
functions are provided for backward compatibility. Use |snmprealwalk| instead.

{hostname} The SNMP agent.

{community} The read community.

{object_id} If NULL, {object_id} is taken as the root of the SNMP objects tree
and all objects under that tree are returned as an array.

If {object_id} is specified, all the SNMP objects below that {object_id} are
returned.

{timeout}

{retries}

Returns an associative array with object ids and their respective object value
starting from the {object_id} as root or FALSE on error.

|snmpwalkoid| Example

<?php >
  $a = snmpwalkoid("127.0.0.1", "public", ""); 
  for (reset($a); $i = key($a); next($a)) {
      echo "$i: $a[$i]<br />\n";
  }
?>





Above function call would return all the SNMP objects from the SNMP agent
running on localhost. One can step through the values with a loop
