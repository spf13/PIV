fbsql_set_lob_mode -- Set the LOB retrieve mode for a FrontBase result set

  bool fbsql_set_lob_mode(resource result, int lob_mode)~

Sets the mode for retrieving LOB data from the database.

When BLOB and CLOB data is retrieved in FrontBase it can be retrieved direct
or indirect. Direct retrieved LOB data will always be fetched no matter the
setting of the lob mode. If the LOB data is less than 512 bytes it will always
be retrieved directly.

{ result}A result identifier returned by |fbsql_query| or |fbsql_db_query|.

{lob_mode} Can be one of: FBSQL_LOB_DIRECT - LOB data is retrieved directly.
When data is fetched from the database with |fbsql_fetch_row|, and other fetch
functions, all CLOB and BLOB columns will be returned as ordinary columns.
This is the default value on a new FrontBase result.

FBSQL_LOB_HANDLE - LOB data is retrieved as handles to the data. When data is
fetched from the database with |fbsql_fetch_row|, and other fetch functions,
LOB data will be returned as a handle to the data if the data is stored
indirect or the data if it is stored direct. If a handle is returned it will
be a 27 byte string formatted as @'000000000000000000000000'.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
