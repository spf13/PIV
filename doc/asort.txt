asort -- Sort an array and maintain index association

  bool asort(array array [, int sort_flags])~

This function sorts an array such that array indices maintain their
correlation with the array elements they are associated with. This is used
mainly when sorting associative arrays where the actual element order is
significant.

{array} The input array.

{sort_flags} You may modify the behavior of the sort using the optional
parameter {sort_flags}, for details see |sort|.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

|asort| example

<?php >
  $fruits = array("d" => "lemon", "a" => "orange", "b" => "banana", "c" => "apple");
  asort($fruits);
  foreach ($fruits as $key => $val) {
      echo "$key = $val\n";
  }
?>

The above example will output:

  c = apple
  b = banana
  d = lemon
  a = orange

The fruits have been sorted in alphabetical order, and the index associated
with each element has been maintained.
