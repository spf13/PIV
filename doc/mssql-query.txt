mssql_query -- Send MS SQL query

  mixed mssql_query(string query [, resource link_identifier [, int batch_size]])~

|mssql_query| sends a query to the currently active database on the server
that's associated with the specified link identifier.

{query} A SQL query.

{link_identifier} A MS SQL link identifier, returned by |mssql_connect| or
|mssql_pconnect|.

If the link identifier isn't specified, the last opened link is assumed. If no
link is open, the function tries to establish a link as if |mssql_connect| was
called, and use it.

{batch_size} The number of records to batch in the buffer.

Returns a MS SQL result resource on success, TRUE if no rows were returned, or
FALSE on error.

|mssql_query| example

<?php >
  // Connect to MSSQL
  $link = mssql_connect('KALLESPC\SQLEXPRESS', 'sa', 'phpfi');
  
  if(!$link || !mssql_select_db('php', $link))
  {
  	die('Unable to connect or select database!');
  }
  
  // Do a simple query, select the version of 
  // MSSQL and print it.
  $version = mssql_query('SELECT @@VERSION');
  $row = mssql_fetch_array($version);
  
  echo $row[0];
  
  // Clean up
  mssql_free_result($version);
?>





If the query returns multiple results then it is necessary to fetch all
results by |mssql_next_result| or free the results by |mssql_free_result|
before executing next query.

|mssql_select_db| |mssql_connect|
