mysql_query -- Send a MySQL query

  resource mysql_query(string query [, resource link_identifier])~

|mysql_query| sends a unique query (multiple queries are not supported) to the
currently active database on the server that's associated with the specified
{link_identifier}.

{query} A SQL query

The query string should not end with a semicolon.

{ link_identifier}The MySQL connection. If the link identifier is not
specified, the last link opened by |mysql_connect| is assumed. If no such link
is found, it will try to create one as if |mysql_connect| was called with no
arguments. If by chance no connection is found or established, an E_WARNING
level error is generated.

For SELECT, SHOW, DESCRIBE, EXPLAIN and other statements returning resultset,
|mysql_query| returns a resource on success, or FALSE on error.

For other type of SQL statements, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, etc,
|mysql_query| returns TRUE on success or FALSE on error.

The returned result resource should be passed to |mysql_fetch_array|, and
other functions for dealing with result tables, to access the returned data.

Use |mysql_num_rows| to find out how many rows were returned for a SELECT
statement or |mysql_affected_rows| to find out how many rows were affected by
a DELETE, INSERT, REPLACE, or UPDATE statement.

|mysql_query| will also fail and return FALSE if the user does not have
permission to access the table(s) referenced by the query.

Invalid Query The following query is syntactically invalid, so |mysql_query|
fails and returns FALSE.

<?php >
  $result = mysql_query('SELECT * WHERE 1=1');
  if (!$result) {
      die('Invalid query: ' . mysql_error());
  }
?>



Valid Query The following query is valid, so |mysql_query| returns a resource.

<?php >
  // This could be supplied by a user, for example
  $firstname = 'fred';
  $lastname  = 'fox';
  
  // Formulate Query
  // This is the best way to perform a SQL query
  // For more examples, see mysql_real_escape_string()
  $query = sprintf("SELECT firstname, lastname, address, age FROM friends WHERE firstname='%s' AND lastname='%s'",
      mysql_real_escape_string($firstname),
      mysql_real_escape_string($lastname));
  
  // Perform Query
  $result = mysql_query($query);
  
  // Check result
  // This shows the actual query sent to MySQL, and the error. Useful for debugging.
  if (!$result) {
      $message  = 'Invalid query: ' . mysql_error() . "\n";
      $message .= 'Whole query: ' . $query;
      die($message);
  }
  
  // Use result
  // Attempting to print $result won't allow access to information in the resource
  // One of the mysql result functions must be used
  // See also mysql_result(), mysql_fetch_array(), mysql_fetch_row(), etc.
  while ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) {
      echo $row['firstname'];
      echo $row['lastname'];
      echo $row['address'];
      echo $row['age'];
  }
  
  // Free the resources associated with the result set
  // This is done automatically at the end of the script
  mysql_free_result($result);
?>
