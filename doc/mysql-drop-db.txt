mysql_drop_db -- Drop (delete) a MySQL database

  bool mysql_drop_db(string database_name [, resource link_identifier])~

|mysql_drop_db| attempts to drop (remove) an entire database from the server
associated with the specified link identifier. This function is deprecated, it
is preferable to use |mysql_query| to issue a sql DROP DATABASE statement
instead.

{database_name} The name of the database that will be deleted.

{ link_identifier}The MySQL connection. If the link identifier is not
specified, the last link opened by |mysql_connect| is assumed. If no such link
is found, it will try to create one as if |mysql_connect| was called with no
arguments. If by chance no connection is found or established, an E_WARNING
level error is generated.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

|mysql_drop_db| alternative example

<?php >
  $link = mysql_connect('localhost', 'mysql_user', 'mysql_password');
  if (!$link) {
      die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error());
  }
  
  $sql = 'DROP DATABASE my_db';
  if (mysql_query($sql, $link)) {
      echo "Database my_db was successfully dropped\n";
  } else {
      echo 'Error dropping database: ' . mysql_error() . "\n";
  }
?>





This function will not be available if the MySQL extension was built against a
MySQL 4.x client library.

For backward compatibility, the following deprecated alias may be used:
|mysql_dropdb|

|mysql_query|
