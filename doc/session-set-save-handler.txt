session_set_save_handler -- Sets user-level session storage functions

  bool session_set_save_handler(callback open, callback close, callback read, callback write, callback destroy, callback gc)~

|session_set_save_handler| sets the user-level session storage functions which
are used for storing and retrieving data associated with a session. This is
most useful when a storage method other than those supplied by PHP sessions is
preferred. i.e. Storing the session data in a local database.

{open} Open function, this works like a constructor in classes and is executed
when the session is being opened. The open function expects two parameters,
where the first is the save path and the second is the session name.

{close} Close function, this works like a destructor in classes and is
executed when the session operation is done.

{read} Read function must return string value always to make save handler work
as expected. Return empty string if there is no data to read. Return values
from other handlers are converted to boolean expression. TRUE for success,
FALSE for failure.

{write} The "write" handler is not executed until after the output stream is
closed. Thus, output from debugging statements in the "write" handler will
never be seen in the browser. If debugging output is necessary, it is
suggested that the debug output be written to a file instead.

{destroy} The destroy handler, this is executed when a session is destroyed
with |session_destroy| and takes the session id as its only parameter.

{gc} The garbage collector, this is executed when the session garbage
collector is executed and takes the max session lifetime as its only
parameter.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

|session_set_save_handler| example The following example provides file based
session storage similar to the PHP sessions default save handler {files}. This
example could easily be extended to cover database storage using your favorite
PHP supported database engine.

<?php >
  function open($save_path, $session_name)
  {
    global $sess_save_path;
  
    $sess_save_path = $save_path;
    return(true);
  }
  
  function close()
  {
    return(true);
  }
  
  function read($id)
  {
    global $sess_save_path;
  
    $sess_file = "$sess_save_path/sess_$id";
    return (string) @file_get_contents($sess_file);
  }
  
  function write($id, $sess_data)
  {
    global $sess_save_path;
  
    $sess_file = "$sess_save_path/sess_$id";
    if ($fp = @fopen($sess_file, "w")) {
      $return = fwrite($fp, $sess_data);
      fclose($fp);
      return $return;
    } else {
      return(false);
    }
  
  }
  
  function destroy($id)
  {
    global $sess_save_path;
  
    $sess_file = "$sess_save_path/sess_$id";
    return(@unlink($sess_file));
  }
  
  function gc($maxlifetime)
  {
    global $sess_save_path;
  
    foreach (glob("$sess_save_path/sess_*") as $filename) {
      if (filemtime($filename) + $maxlifetime < time()) {
        @unlink($filename);
      }
    }
    return true;
  }
  
  session_set_save_handler("open", "close", "read", "write", "destroy", "gc");
  
  session_start();
  
  // proceed to use sessions normally
?>



As of PHP 5.0.5 the {write} and {close} handlers are called after object
destruction and therefore cannot use objects or throw exceptions. The object
destructors can however use sessions.

It is possible to call |session_write_close| from the destructor to solve this
chicken and egg problem.

Current working directory is changed with some SAPIs if session is closed in
the script termination. It is possible to close the session earlier with
|session_write_close|.
