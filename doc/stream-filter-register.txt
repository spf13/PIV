stream_filter_register -- Register a user defined stream filter

  bool stream_filter_register(string filtername, string classname)~

|stream_filter_register| allows you to implement your own filter on any
registered stream used with all the other filesystem functions (such as
|fopen|, |fread| etc.).

{filtername} The filter name to be registered.

{classname} To implement a filter, you need to define a class as an extension
of php_user_filter with a number of member functions as defined below. When
performing read/write operations on the stream to which your filter is
attached, PHP will pass the data through your filter (and any other filters
attached to that stream) so that the data may be modified as desired. You must
implement the methods exactly as described below - doing otherwise will lead
to undefined behaviour.

  int filter(string filtername, string classname, resource in, resource out, int consumed, bool closing)~

This method is called whenever data is read from or written to the attached
stream (such as with |fread| or |fwrite|). {in} is a resource pointing to a
bucket brigade which contains one or more bucket objects containing data to be
filtered. {out} is a resource pointing to a second bucket brigade into which
your modified buckets should be placed. {consumed}, which must always be
declared by reference, should be incremented by the length of the data which
your filter reads in and alters. In most cases this means you will increment
{consumed} by $bucket->datalen for each $bucket. If the stream is in the
process of closing (and therefore this is the last pass through the
filterchain), the {closing} parameter will be set to TRUE. The filter method
must return one of three values upon completion. Return Value Meaning
PSFS_PASS_ON Filter processed successfully with data available in the {out}
bucket brigade. PSFS_FEED_ME Filter processed successfully, however no data
was available to return. More data is required from the stream or prior
filter. PSFS_ERR_FATAL (default) The filter experienced an unrecoverable error
and cannot continue.

  bool onCreate(string filtername, string classname, resource in, resource out, int consumed, bool closing)~

This method is called during instantiation of the filter class object. If your
filter allocates or initializes any other resources (such as a buffer), this
is the place to do it. Your implementation of this method should return FALSE
on failure, or TRUE on success.

When your filter is first instantiated, and yourfilter->onCreate() is called,
a number of properties will be available as shown in the table below.

Property Contents FilterClass->filtername A string containing the name the
filter was instantiated with. Filters may be registered under multiple names
or under wildcards. Use this property to determine which name was used.
FilterClass->params The contents of the {params} parameter passed to
|stream_filter_append| or |stream_filter_prepend|. FilterClass->stream The
stream resource being filtered. Maybe available only during filter calls when
the closing parameter is set to FALSE.

  void onClose(string filtername, string classname, resource in, resource out, int consumed, bool closing)~

This method is called upon filter shutdown (typically, this is also during
stream shutdown), and is executed after the flush method is called. If any
resources were allocated or initialzed during onCreate() this would be the
time to destroy or dispose of them.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

|stream_filter_register| will return FALSE if the {filtername} is already
defined.

Filter for capitalizing characters on foo-bar.txt stream The example below
implements a filter named strtoupper on the foo-bar.txt stream which will
capitalize all letter characters written to/read from that stream.

<?php >
  /* Define our filter class */
  class strtoupper_filter extends php_user_filter {
    function filter($in, $out, &amp;$consumed, $closing)
    {
      while ($bucket = stream_bucket_make_writeable($in)) {
        $bucket->data = strtoupper($bucket->data);
        $consumed += $bucket->datalen;
        stream_bucket_append($out, $bucket);
      }
      return PSFS_PASS_ON;
    }
  }
  
  /* Register our filter with PHP */
  stream_filter_register("strtoupper", "strtoupper_filter")
      or die("Failed to register filter");
  
  $fp = fopen("foo-bar.txt", "w");
  
  /* Attach the registered filter to the stream just opened */
  stream_filter_append($fp, "strtoupper");
  
  fwrite($fp, "Line1\n");
  fwrite($fp, "Word - 2\n");
  fwrite($fp, "Easy As 123\n");
  
  fclose($fp);
  
  /* Read the contents back out
   */
  readfile("foo-bar.txt");
?>

The above example will output:

  LINE1
  WORD - 2
  EASY AS 123



Registering a generic filter class to match multiple filter names.

<?php >
  /* Define our filter class */
  class string_filter extends php_user_filter {
    var $mode;
  
    function filter($in, $out, &amp;$consumed, $closing)
    {
      while ($bucket = stream_bucket_make_writeable($in)) {
        if ($this->mode == 1) {
          $bucket->data = strtoupper($bucket->data);
        } elseif ($this->mode == 0) {
          $bucket->data = strtolower($bucket->data);
        }
  
        $consumed += $bucket->datalen;
        stream_bucket_append($out, $bucket);
      }
      return PSFS_PASS_ON;
    }
  
    function onCreate()
    {
      if ($this->filtername == 'str.toupper') {
        $this->mode = 1;
      } elseif ($this->filtername == 'str.tolower') {
        $this->mode = 0;
      } else {
        /* Some other str.* filter was asked for,
           report failure so that PHP will keep looking */
        return false;
      }
  
      return true;
    }
  }
  
  /* Register our filter with PHP */
  stream_filter_register("str.*", "string_filter")
      or die("Failed to register filter");
  
  $fp = fopen("foo-bar.txt", "w");
  
  /* Attach the registered filter to the stream just opened
     We could alternately bind to str.tolower here */
  stream_filter_append($fp, "str.toupper");
  
  fwrite($fp, "Line1\n");
  fwrite($fp, "Word - 2\n");
  fwrite($fp, "Easy As 123\n");
  
  fclose($fp);
  
  /* Read the contents back out
   */
  readfile("foo-bar.txt");
?>

The above example will output:

  LINE1
  WORD - 2
  EASY AS 123
