SDO_DAS_Setting::getListIndex -- Get the list index for a changed many-valued
property

  int SDO_DAS_Setting::getListIndex()~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

Get the list index for a modification made to an element of a many-valued
property. For example, if we modified the third element of a many-valued
property we could obtain an SDO_DAS_Setting from the change summary
corresponding to that modification. A call to |getListIndex| on that setting
would return the value 2 (lists are indexed from zero).

None.

The list index for the element of the many-valued property which has been
changed.
