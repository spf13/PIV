each -- Return the current key and value pair from an array and advance the
array cursor

  array each(array array)~

Return the current key and value pair from an array and advance the array
cursor.

After |each| has executed, the array cursor will be left on the next element
of the array, or past the last element if it hits the end of the array. You
have to use |reset| if you want to traverse the array again using each.

{array} The input array.

Returns the current key and value pair from the array {array}. This pair is
returned in a four-element array, with the keys 0, 1, key, and value. Elements
0 and key contain the key name of the array element, and 1 and value contain
the data.

If the internal pointer for the array points past the end of the array
contents, |each| returns FALSE.

|each| examples

<?php >
  $foo = array("bob", "fred", "jussi", "jouni", "egon", "marliese");
  $bar = each($foo);
  print_r($bar);
?>

$bar now contains the following key/value pairs:

  Array
  (
      [1] => bob
      [value] => bob
      [0] => 0
      [key] => 0
  )



<?php >
  $foo = array("Robert" => "Bob", "Seppo" => "Sepi");
  $bar = each($foo);
  print_r($bar);
?>

$bar now contains the following key/value pairs:

  Array
  (
      [1] => Bob
      [value] => Bob
      [0] => Robert
      [key] => Robert
  )

|each| is typically used in conjunction with |list| to traverse an array,
here's an example: Traversing an array with |each|

<?php >
  $fruit = array('a' => 'apple', 'b' => 'banana', 'c' => 'cranberry');
  
  reset($fruit);
  while (list($key, $val) = each($fruit)) {
      echo "$key => $val\n";
  }
?>

The above example will output:

  a => apple
  b => banana
  c => cranberry



Because assigning an array to another variable resets the original arrays
pointer, our example above would cause an endless loop had we assigned $fruit
to another variable inside the loop.

|each| will also accept objects, but may return unexpected results. Its
therefore not recommended to iterate though object properties with |each|.

|key| |list| |current| |reset| |next| |prev| foreach Object Iteration
