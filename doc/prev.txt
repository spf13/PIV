prev -- Rewind the internal array pointer

  mixed prev(array array)~

Rewind the internal array pointer.

|prev| behaves just like |next|, except it rewinds the internal array pointer
one place instead of advancing it.

{array} The input array.

Returns the array value in the previous place that's pointed to by the
internal array pointer, or FALSE if there are no more elements.

Example use of |prev| and friends

<?php >
  $transport = array('foot', 'bike', 'car', 'plane');
  $mode = current($transport); // $mode = 'foot';
  $mode = next($transport);    // $mode = 'bike';
  $mode = next($transport);    // $mode = 'car';
  $mode = prev($transport);    // $mode = 'bike';
  $mode = end($transport);     // $mode = 'plane';
?>





This function may return Boolean FALSE, but may also return a non-Boolean
value which evaluates to FALSE, such as 0 or "". Please read the section on
Booleans for more information. Use the === operator for testing the return
value of this function.

You won't be able to distinguish the beginning of an array from a boolean
FALSE element. To properly traverse an array which may contain FALSE elements,
see the |each| function.

|current| |end| |next| |reset| |each|
