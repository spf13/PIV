db2_close -- Closes a database connection

  bool db2_close(resource connection)~

This function closes a DB2 client connection created with |db2_connect| and
returns the corresponding resources to the database server.

If you attempt to close a persistent DB2 client connection created with
|db2_pconnect|, the close request is ignored and the persistent DB2 client
connection remains available for the next caller.

{connection} Specifies an active DB2 client connection.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

Closing a connection The following example demonstrates a successful attempt
to close a connection to an IBM DB2, Cloudscape, or Apache Derby database.

<?php >
  $conn = db2_connect('SAMPLE', 'db2inst1', 'ibmdb2');
  $rc = db2_close($conn);
  if ($rc) {
      echo "Connection was successfully closed.";
  }
?>

The above example will output:

  Connection was successfully closed.
