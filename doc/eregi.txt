eregi -- Case insensitive regular expression match

  int eregi(string pattern, string string [, array regs])~

This function is identical to |ereg| except that it ignores case distinction
when matching alphabetic characters.

{pattern} Case insensitive regular expression.

{string} The input string.

{regs} If matches are found for parenthesized substrings of {pattern} and the
function is called with the third argument {regs}, the matches will be stored
in the elements of the array {regs}.

$regs[1] will contain the substring which starts at the first left
parenthesis; $regs[2] will contain the substring starting at the second, and
so on. $regs[0] will contain a copy of the complete string matched.

Returns the length of the matched string if a match for {pattern} was found in
{string}, or FALSE if no matches were found or an error occurred.

If the optional parameter {regs} was not passed or the length of the matched
string is 0, this function returns 1.

|eregi| example

<?php >
  $string = 'XYZ';
  if (eregi('z', $string)) {
      echo "'$string' contains a 'z' or 'Z'!";
  }
?>





As of PHP 5.3.0 the regex extension is deprecated, calling this function will
issue an E_DEPRECATED notice.
