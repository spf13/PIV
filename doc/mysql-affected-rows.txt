mysql_affected_rows -- Get number of affected rows in previous MySQL operation

  int mysql_affected_rows([resource link_identifier])~

Get the number of affected rows by the last INSERT, UPDATE, REPLACE or DELETE
query associated with {link_identifier}.

{ link_identifier}The MySQL connection. If the link identifier is not
specified, the last link opened by |mysql_connect| is assumed. If no such link
is found, it will try to create one as if |mysql_connect| was called with no
arguments. If by chance no connection is found or established, an E_WARNING
level error is generated.

Returns the number of affected rows on success, and -1 if the last query
failed.

If the last query was a DELETE query with no WHERE clause, all of the records
will have been deleted from the table but this function will return zero with
MySQL versions prior to 4.1.2.

When using UPDATE, MySQL will not update columns where the new value is the
same as the old value. This creates the possibility that |mysql_affected_rows|
may not actually equal the number of rows matched, only the number of rows
that were literally affected by the query.

The REPLACE statement first deletes the record with the same primary key and
then inserts the new record. This function returns the number of deleted
records plus the number of inserted records.

|mysql_affected_rows| example

<?php >
  $link = mysql_connect('localhost', 'mysql_user', 'mysql_password');
  if (!$link) {
      die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error());
  }
  mysql_select_db('mydb');
  
  /* this should return the correct numbers of deleted records */
  mysql_query('DELETE FROM mytable WHERE id < 10');
  printf("Records deleted: %d\n", mysql_affected_rows());
  
  /* with a where clause that is never true, it should return 0 */
  mysql_query('DELETE FROM mytable WHERE 0');
  printf("Records deleted: %d\n", mysql_affected_rows());
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  Records deleted: 10
  Records deleted: 0



|mysql_affected_rows| example using transactions

<?php >
  $link = mysql_connect('localhost', 'mysql_user', 'mysql_password');
  if (!$link) {
      die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error());
  }
  mysql_select_db('mydb');
  
  /* Update records */
  mysql_query("UPDATE mytable SET used=1 WHERE id < 10");
  printf ("Updated records: %d\n", mysql_affected_rows());
  mysql_query("COMMIT");
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  Updated Records: 10



If you are using transactions, you need to call |mysql_affected_rows| after
your INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE query, not after the COMMIT.

To retrieve the number of rows returned by a SELECT, it is possible to use
|mysql_num_rows|.
