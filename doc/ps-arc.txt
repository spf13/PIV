  bool ps_arc(resource psdoc, float x, float y, float radius, float alpha, float beta)~

Draws a portion of a circle with at middle point at ({x}, {y}). The arc starts
at an angle of {alpha} and ends at an angle of {beta}. It is drawn
counterclockwise (use |ps_arcn| to draw clockwise). The subpath added to the
current path starts on the arc at angle {alpha} and ends on the arc at angle
{beta}.

{psdoc} Resource identifier of the postscript file as returned by |ps_new|.

{x} The x-coordinate of the circle's middle point.

{y} The y-coordinate of the circle's middle point.

{radius} The radius of the circle

{alpha} The start angle given in degrees.
