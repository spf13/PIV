is_readable -- Tells whether the filename is readable

  bool is_readable(string filename)~

Tells whether the filename is readable.

{filename} Path to the file.

Returns TRUE if the file or directory specified by {filename} exists and is
readable, FALSE otherwise.

|is_readable| example

<?php >
  $filename = 'test.txt';
  if (is_readable($filename)) {
      echo 'The file is readable';
  } else {
      echo 'The file is not readable';
  }
?>





Keep in mind that PHP may be accessing the file as the user id that the web
server runs as (often 'nobody'). Safe mode limitations are not taken into
account before PHP 5.1.5.

The results of this function are cached. See |clearstatcache| for more
details.

As of PHP 5.0.0, this function can also be used with some URL wrappers. Refer
to for a listing of which wrappers support |stat| family of functionality.

The check is done using the real UID/GID instead of the effective one.
