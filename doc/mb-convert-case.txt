mb_convert_case -- Perform case folding on a string

  string mb_convert_case(string str, int mode [, string encoding])~

Performs case folding on a string, converted in the way specified by {mode}.

{str} The string being converted.

{mode} The mode of the conversion. It can be one of MB_CASE_UPPER,
MB_CASE_LOWER, or MB_CASE_TITLE.

{encoding} The {encoding} parameter is the character encoding. If it is
omitted, the internal character encoding value will be used.

A case folded version of {string} converted in the way specified by {mode}.

By contrast to the standard case folding functions such as |strtolower| and
|strtoupper|, case folding is performed on the basis of the Unicode character
properties. Thus the behaviour of this function is not affected by locale
settings and it can convert any characters that have 'alphabetic' property,
such as A-umlaut (&Auml;).

For more information about the Unicode properties, please see
