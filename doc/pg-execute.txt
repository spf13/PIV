pg_execute -- Sends a request to execute a prepared statement with given
parameters, and waits for the result.

  resource pg_execute([resource connection, string stmtname, array params])~

Sends a request to execute a prepared statement with given parameters, and
waits for the result.

|pg_execute| is like |pg_query_params|, but the command to be executed is
specified by naming a previously-prepared statement, instead of giving a query
string. This feature allows commands that will be used repeatedly to be parsed
and planned just once, rather than each time they are executed. The statement
must have been prepared previously in the current session. |pg_execute| is
supported only against PostgreSQL 7.4 or higher connections; it will fail when
using earlier versions.

The parameters are identical to |pg_query_params|, except that the name of a
prepared statement is given instead of a query string.

{connection} PostgreSQL database connection resource. When {connection} is not
present, the default connection is used. The default connection is the last
connection made by |pg_connect| or |pg_pconnect|.

{stmtname} The name of the prepared statement to execute. if "" is specified,
then the unnamed statement is executed. The name must have been previously
prepared using |pg_prepare|, |pg_send_prepare| or a PREPARE SQL command.

{params} An array of parameter values to substitute for the $1, $2, etc.
placeholders in the original prepared query string. The number of elements in
the array must match the number of placeholders.

Elements are converted to strings by calling this function.

A query result resource on success, or FALSE on failure.

Using |pg_execute|

<?php >
  // Connect to a database named "mary"
  $dbconn = pg_connect("dbname=mary");
  
  // Prepare a query for execution
  $result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "my_query", 'SELECT * FROM shops WHERE name = $1');
  
  // Execute the prepared query.  Note that it is not necessary to escape
  // the string "Joe's Widgets" in any way
  $result = pg_execute($dbconn, "my_query", array("Joe's Widgets"));
  
  // Execute the same prepared query, this time with a different parameter
  $result = pg_execute($dbconn, "my_query", array("Clothes Clothes Clothes"));
?>





|pg_prepare| |pg_send_prepare| |pg_query_params|
