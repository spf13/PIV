array_diff -- Computes the difference of arrays

  array array_diff(array array1, array array2 [, array ...])~

Compares {array1} against {array2} and returns the difference.

{array1} The array to compare from

{array2} An array to compare against

{...} More arrays to compare against

Returns an array containing all the entries from {array1} that are not present
in any of the other arrays.

|array_diff| example

<?php >
  $array1 = array("a" => "green", "red", "blue", "red");
  $array2 = array("b" => "green", "yellow", "red");
  $result = array_diff($array1, $array2);
  
  print_r($result);
?>

Multiple occurrences in $array1 are all treated the same way. This will output
:

  Array
  (
      [1] => blue
  )



Two elements are considered equal if and only if (string) $elem1 === (string)
$elem2. In words: when the string representation is the same.

This function only checks one dimension of a n-dimensional array. Of course
you can check deeper dimensions by using array_diff($array1[0], $array2[0]);.
