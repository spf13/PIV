ereg_replace -- Replace regular expression

  string ereg_replace(string pattern, string replacement, string string)~

This function scans {string} for matches to {pattern}, then replaces the
matched text with {replacement}.

{pattern} A POSIX extended regular expression.

{replacement} If {pattern} contains parenthesized substrings, {replacement}
may contain substrings of the form \\digit, which will be replaced by the text
matching the digit'th parenthesized substring; \\0 will produce the entire
contents of string. Up to nine substrings may be used. Parentheses may be
nested, in which case they are counted by the opening parenthesis.

{string} The input string.

The modified string is returned. If no matches are found in {string}, then it
will be returned unchanged.

For example, the following code snippet prints "This was a test" three times:

|ereg_replace| example

<?php >
  $string = "This is a test";
  echo str_replace(" is", " was", $string);
  echo ereg_replace("( )is", "\\1was", $string);
  echo ereg_replace("(( )is)", "\\2was", $string);
?>





One thing to take note of is that if you use an integer value as the
{replacement} parameter, you may not get the results you expect. This is
because |ereg_replace| will interpret the number as the ordinal value of a
character, and apply that. For instance:

|ereg_replace| example

<?php >
  /* This will not work as expected. */
  $num = 4;
  $string = "This string has four words.";
  $string = ereg_replace('four', $num, $string);
  echo $string;   /* Output: 'This string has   words.' */
  
  /* This will work. */
  $num = '4';
  $string = "This string has four words.";
  $string = ereg_replace('four', $num, $string);
  echo $string;   /* Output: 'This string has 4 words.' */
?>





Replace URLs with links

<?php >
  $text = ereg_replace("[[:alpha:]]+://[^<>[:space:]]+[[:alnum:]/]",
                       "<a href=\"\\0\">\\0</a>", $text);
?>





As of PHP 5.3.0 the regex extension is deprecated, calling this function will
issue an E_DEPRECATED notice.

|preg_replace|, which uses a Perl-compatible regular expression syntax, is
often a faster alternative to |ereg_replace|.
