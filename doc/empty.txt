empty -- Determine whether a variable is empty

  bool empty(mixed var)~

Determine whether a variable is considered to be empty.

{var} Variable to be checked

|empty| only checks variables as anything else will result in a parse error.
In other words, the following will not work: empty(trim($name)).

|empty| is the opposite of (boolean) var, except that no warning is generated
when the variable is not set.

Returns FALSE if {var} has a non-empty and non-zero value.

The following things are considered to be empty: "" (an empty string) 0 (0 as
an integer) "0" (0 as a string) NULL FALSE array() (an empty array) var $var;
(a variable declared, but without a value in a class)

Version Description PHP 5 As of PHP 5, objects with no properties are no
longer considered empty.

PHP 4 As of PHP 4, The string value "0" is considered empty.

A simple |empty| / |isset| comparison.

<?php >
  $var = 0;
  
  // Evaluates to true because $var is empty
  if (empty($var)) {
      echo '$var is either 0, empty, or not set at all';
  }
  
  // Evaluates as true because $var is set
  if (isset($var)) {
      echo '$var is set even though it is empty';
  }
?>





Because this is a language construct and not a function, it cannot be called
using variable functions

When using |empty| on inaccessible object properties, the __isset overloading
method will be called, if declared.

|isset| __isset |unset| |array_key_exists| |count| |strlen| The type
comparison tables
