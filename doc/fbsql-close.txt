fbsql_close -- Close FrontBase connection

  bool fbsql_close([resource link_identifier])~

Closes the connection to the FrontBase server that's associated with the
specified link identifier.

Using |fbsql_close| isn't usually necessary, as non-persistent open links are
automatically closed at the end of the script's execution.

{ link_identifier}A FrontBase link identifier returned by |fbsql_connect| or
|fbsql_pconnect|.

If optional and not specified, the function will try to find an open link to
the FrontBase server and if no such link is found it will try to create one as
if |fbsql_connect| was called with no arguments.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

|fbsql_close| example

<?php >
  $link = fbsql_connect("localhost", "_SYSTEM", "secret")
      or die("Could not connect");
  echo "Connected successfully";
  fbsql_close($link);
?>
