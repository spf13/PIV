gmp_div_qr -- Divide numbers and get quotient and remainder

  array gmp_div_qr(resource n, resource d [, int round])~

The function divides {n} by {d}.

{n} The number being divided.

It can be either a GMP number resource, or a numeric string given that it is
possible to convert the latter to a number.

{d} The number that {n} is being divided by.

It can be either a GMP number resource, or a numeric string given that it is
possible to convert the latter to a number.

{round} See the |gmp_div_q| function for description of the {round} argument.

Returns an array, with the first element being [n/d] (the integer result of
the division) and the second being (n - [n/d] * d) (the remainder of the
division).
