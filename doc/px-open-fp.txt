px_open_fp -- Open paradox database

  bool px_open_fp(resource pxdoc, resource file)~

would like to investigate a primary index. It cannot be used to accelerate
access to a database file.

{pxdoc} Resource identifier of the paradox database as returned by |px_new|.

{file} {file} is the return value from |fopen| with the actual database file
as parameter. Make sure the database is writable if you plan to update or
insert records.
