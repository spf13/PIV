unset -- Unset a given variable

  void unset(mixed var [, mixed var [, mixed ...]])~

|unset| destroys the specified variables.

The behavior of |unset| inside of a function can vary depending on what type
of variable you are attempting to destroy.

If a globalized variable is |unset| inside of a function, only the local
variable is destroyed. The variable in the calling environment will retain the
same value as before |unset| was called.

<?php >
  function destroy_foo() 
  {
      global $foo;
      unset($foo);
  }
  
  $foo = 'bar';
  destroy_foo();
  echo $foo;
?>

The above example will output:

  bar

If you would like to |unset| a global variable inside of a function, you can
use the $GLOBALS array to do so:

<?php >
  function foo() 
  {
      unset($GLOBALS['bar']);
  }
  
  $bar = "something";
  foo();
?>

If a variable that is PASSED BY REFERENCE is |unset| inside of a function,
only the local variable is destroyed. The variable in the calling environment
will retain the same value as before |unset| was called.

<?php >
  function foo(&amp;$bar) 
  {
      unset($bar);
      $bar = "blah";
  }
  
  $bar = 'something';
  echo "$bar\n";
  
  foo($bar);
  echo "$bar\n";
?>

The above example will output:

  something
  something

If a static variable is |unset| inside of a function, |unset| destroys the
variable only in the context of the rest of a function. Following calls will
restore the previous value of a variable.

<?php >
  function foo()
  {
      static $bar;
      $bar++;
      echo "Before unset: $bar, ";
      unset($bar);
      $bar = 23;
      echo "after unset: $bar\n";
  }
  
  foo();
  foo();
  foo();
?>

The above example will output:

  Before unset: 1, after unset: 23
  Before unset: 2, after unset: 23
  Before unset: 3, after unset: 23

{var} The variable to be unset.

{var} Another variable ..

{...}

No value is returned.

Version Description 4.0.1 Added support for multiple arguments. 4.0.0 |unset|
became an expression. (In PHP 3, |unset| would always return 1).

|unset| example

<?php >
  // destroy a single variable
  unset($foo);
  
  // destroy a single element of an array
  unset($bar['quux']);
  
  // destroy more than one variable
  unset($foo1, $foo2, $foo3);
?>



Using (unset) casting

<?php >
  $name = 'Felipe';
  
  var_dump((unset) $name);
?>





Because this is a language construct and not a function, it cannot be called
using variable functions

It is possible to unset even object properties visible in current context.

It is not possible to unset $this inside an object method since PHP 5.

When using |unset| on inaccessible object properties, the __unset overloading
method will be called, if declared.

|isset| |empty| __unset |array_splice|
