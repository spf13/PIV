xdiff_file_patch -- Patch a file with an unified diff

  mixed xdiff_file_patch(string file, string patch, string dest [, int flags])~

Patches a {file} with a {patch} and stores the result in a file. {patch} has
to be an unified diff created by |xdiff_file_diff|/|xdiff_string_diff|
function. An optional {flags} parameter specifies mode of operation.

{file} The original file.

{patch} The unified patch file. It has to be created using
|xdiff_string_diff|, |xdiff_file_diff| functions or compatible tools.

{dest} Path of the resulting file.

{flags} Can be either XDIFF_PATCH_NORMAL (default mode, normal patch) or
XDIFF_PATCH_REVERSE (reversed patch).

Starting from version 1.5.0, you can also use binary OR to enable
XDIFF_PATCH_IGNORESPACE flag.

Returns FALSE if an internal error happened, string with rejected chunks if
patch couldn't be applied or TRUE if patch has been successfully applied.

|xdiff_file_patch| example The following code applies unified diff to a file.

<?php >
  $old_version = 'my_script-1.0.php';
  $patch = 'my_script.patch';
  
  $errors = xdiff_file_patch($old_version, $patch, 'my_script-1.1.php');
  if (is_string($errors)) {
     echo "Rejects:\n";
     echo $errors;
  }
?>

Patch reversing example The following code reverses a patch.

<?php >
  $new_version = 'my_script-1.1.php';
  $patch = 'my_script.patch';
  
  $errors = xdiff_file_patch($new_version, $patch, 'my_script-1.0.php', XDIFF_PATCH_REVERSE);
  if (is_string($errors)) {
     echo "Rejects:\n";
     echo $errors;
  }
?>
