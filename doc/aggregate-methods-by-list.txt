aggregate_methods_by_list -- Selective dynamic class methods aggregation to an
object

  void aggregate_methods_by_list(object object, string class_name, array methods_list [, bool exclude])~

Aggregates methods from a class to an existing object using a list of method
names.

The class constructor or methods whose names start with an underscore
character (_), which are considered private to the aggregated class, are
always excluded.

{object}

{class_name}

{methods_list}

{exclude} The optional parameter {exclude} is used to decide whether the list
contains the names of methods to include in the aggregation (i.e. {exclude} is
FALSE, which is the default value), or to exclude from the aggregation
({exclude} is TRUE).

No value is returned.
