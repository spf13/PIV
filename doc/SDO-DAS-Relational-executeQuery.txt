SDO_DAS_Relational::executeQuery -- Executes a given SQL query against a
relational database and returns the results as a normalised data graph.

  SDODataObject SDO_DAS_Relational::executeQuery(PDO database_handle, string SQL_statement [, array column_specifier])~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

Executes a given query against the relational database, using the supplied PDO
database handle. Uses the model that it built from the the metadata to
interpret the result set. Returns a data graph.

PDO_database_handle Constructed using the PDO extension. A typical line to
construct a PDO database handle might look like this:

  $dbh = new PDO("mysql:dbname=COMPANYDB;host=localhost",DATABASE_USER,DATABASE_PASSWORD);



SQL_statement The SQL statement to be executed against the database.

column_specifier The Relational DAS needs to examine the result set and for
every column, know which table and which column of that table it came from. In
some circumstances it can find this information for itself, but sometimes it
cannot. In these cases a column specifier is needed, which is an array that
identifies the columns. Each entry in the array is simply a string in the form
table-name.column_name.

The column specifier is needed when there are duplicate column names in the
database metadata. For example, in the database used within the examples, all
the tables have both a id and a name column. When the Relational DAS fetches
the result set from PDO it can do so with the PDO_FETCH_ASSOC attribute, which
will cause the columns in the results set to be labelled with the column name,
but will not distinguish duplicates. So this will only work when there are no
duplicates possible in the results set.

To summarise, specify a column specifier array whenever there is any
uncertainty about which column could be from which table and only omit it when
every column name in the database metadata is unique.

All of the examples in the Examples use a column specifier. There is one
example in the Scenarios directory of the installation that does not: that
which works with just the employee table, and because it works with just one
table, there can not exist duplicate column names.

Returns a data graph. Specifically, it returns a root object of a special
type. Under this root object will be the data from the result set. The root
object will have a multi-valued containment property with the same name as the
application root type specified on the constructor, and that property will
contain one or more data objects of the application root type.

In the event that the query returns no data, the special root object will
still be returned but the containment property for the application root type
will be empty.

|SDO_DAS_Relational::executeQuery| can throw an SDO_DAS_Relational_Exception
if it is unable to construct the data graph correctly. This can occur for a
number of reasons: for example if it finds that it does not have primary keys
in the result set for all the objects. It also catches any PDO exceptions and
obtains PDO diagnostic information which it includes in an
SDO_DAS_Relational_Exception which it then throws.

Please see the Examples section in the general information about the
Relational DAS for many examples of calling this method.
