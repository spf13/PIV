pcntl_signal -- Installs a signal handler

  bool pcntl_signal(int signo, callback handler [, bool restart_syscalls])~

The |pcntl_signal| function installs a new signal handler for the signal
indicated by {signo}.

{signo} The signal number.

{handler} The signal handler which may be the name of a user created function,
or method, or either of the two global constants SIG_IGN or SIG_DFL.

Note that when you set a handler to an object method, that object's reference
count is increased which makes it persist until you either change the handler
to something else, or your script ends.

{restart_syscalls} Specifies whether system call restarting should be used
when this signal arrives and defaults to TRUE.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

Version Description 4.3.0 The {restart_syscalls} parameter was added. 4.3.0
The ability to use an object method as a callback became available. 4.3.0 As
of PHP 4.3.0 PCNTL uses ticks as the signal handle callback mechanism, which
is much faster than the previous mechanism. This change follows the same
semantics as using "user ticks". You must use the declare() statement to
specify the locations in your program where callbacks are allowed to occur for
the signal handler to function properly (as used in the above example).

|pcntl_signal| example

<?php >
  // tick use required as of PHP 4.3.0
  declare(ticks = 1);
  
  // signal handler function
  function sig_handler($signo)
  {
  
       switch ($signo) {
           case SIGTERM:
               // handle shutdown tasks
               exit;
               break;
           case SIGHUP:
               // handle restart tasks
               break;
           case SIGUSR1:
               echo "Caught SIGUSR1...\n";
               break;
           default:
               // handle all other signals
       }
  
  }
  
  echo "Installing signal handler...\n";
  
  // setup signal handlers
  pcntl_signal(SIGTERM, "sig_handler");
  pcntl_signal(SIGHUP,  "sig_handler");
  pcntl_signal(SIGUSR1, "sig_handler");
  
  // or use an object, available as of PHP 4.3.0
  // pcntl_signal(SIGUSR1, array($obj, "do_something");
  
  echo"Generating signal SIGTERM to self...\n";
  
  // send SIGUSR1 to current process id
  posix_kill(posix_getpid(), SIGUSR1);
  
  echo "Done\n"
?>
