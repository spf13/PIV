mysql_insert_id -- Get the ID generated from the previous INSERT operation

  int mysql_insert_id([resource link_identifier])~

Retrieves the ID generated for an AUTO_INCREMENT column by the previous INSERT
query.

{ link_identifier}The MySQL connection. If the link identifier is not
specified, the last link opened by |mysql_connect| is assumed. If no such link
is found, it will try to create one as if |mysql_connect| was called with no
arguments. If by chance no connection is found or established, an E_WARNING
level error is generated.

The ID generated for an AUTO_INCREMENT column by the previous INSERT query on
success, 0 if the previous query does not generate an AUTO_INCREMENT value, or
FALSE if no MySQL connection was established.

|mysql_insert_id| example

<?php >
  $link = mysql_connect('localhost', 'mysql_user', 'mysql_password');
  if (!$link) {
      die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error());
  }
  mysql_select_db('mydb');
  
  mysql_query("INSERT INTO mytable (product) values ('kossu')");
  printf("Last inserted record has id %d\n", mysql_insert_id());
?>





|mysql_insert_id| converts the return type of the native MySQL C API function
mysql_insert_id() to a type of long (named int in PHP). If your AUTO_INCREMENT
column has a column type of BIGINT, the value returned by |mysql_insert_id|
will be incorrect. Instead, use the internal MySQL SQL function
LAST_INSERT_ID() in an SQL query.

Because |mysql_insert_id| acts on the last performed query, be sure to call
|mysql_insert_id| immediately after the query that generates the value.

The value of the MySQL SQL function LAST_INSERT_ID() always contains the most
recently generated AUTO_INCREMENT value, and is not reset between queries.
