socket_write -- Write to a socket

  int socket_write(resource socket, string buffer [, int length])~

The function |socket_write| writes to the {socket} from the given {buffer}.

{socket}

{buffer} The buffer to be written.

{length} The optional parameter {length} can specify an alternate length of
bytes written to the socket. If this length is greater then the buffer length,
it is silently truncated to the length of the buffer.

Returns the number of bytes successfully written to the socket or FALSE one
error. The error code can be retrieved with |socket_last_error|. This code may
be passed to |socket_strerror| to get a textual explanation of the error.

It is perfectly valid for |socket_write| to return zero which means no bytes
have been written. Be sure to use the === operator to check for FALSE in case
of an error.

|socket_write| does not necessarily write all bytes from the given buffer.
It's valid that, depending on the network buffers etc., only a certain amount
of data, even one byte, is written though your buffer is greater. You have to
watch out so you don't unintentionally forget to transmit the rest of your
data.
