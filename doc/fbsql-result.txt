fbsql_result -- Get result data

  mixed fbsql_result(resource result [, int row [, mixed field]])~

|fbsql_result| returns the contents of one cell from a FrontBase result set.
The field argument can be the field's offset, or the field's name, or the
field's table dot field's name (tabledname.fieldname). If the column name has
been aliased ('select foo as bar from...'), use the alias instead of the
column name.

When working on large result sets, you should consider using one of the
functions that fetch an entire row (specified below). As these functions
return the contents of multiple cells in one function call, they're MUCH
quicker than |fbsql_result|. Also, note that specifying a numeric offset for
the field argument is much quicker than specifying a fieldname or
tablename.fieldname argument.

Calls to |fbsql_result| should not be mixed with calls to other functions that
deal with the result set.

Recommended high-performance alternatives: |fbsql_fetch_row|,
|fbsql_fetch_array|, and |fbsql_fetch_object|.
