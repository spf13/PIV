crc32 -- Calculates the crc32 polynomial of a string

  int crc32(string str)~

Generates the cyclic redundancy checksum polynomial of 32-bit lengths of the
{str}. This is usually used to validate the integrity of data being
transmitted.

Because PHP's integer type is signed, and many crc32 checksums will result in
negative integers, you need to use the "%u" formatter of |sprintf| or |printf|
to get the string representation of the unsigned crc32 checksum.

{str} The data.

Returns the crc32 checksum of {str} as an integer.

Displaying a crc32 checksum This example shows how to print a converted
checksum with the |printf| function:

<?php >
  $checksum = crc32("The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.");
  printf("%u\n", $checksum);
?>
