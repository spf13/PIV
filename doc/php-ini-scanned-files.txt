php_ini_scanned_files -- Return a list of .ini files parsed from the
additional ini dir

  string php_ini_scanned_files()~

|php_ini_scanned_files| returns a comma-separated list of configuration files
parsed after php.ini. These files are found in a directory defined by the
--with-config-file-scan-dir option which is set during compilation.

The returned configuration files also include the path as declared in the
--with-config-file-scan-dir option.

Returns a comma-separated string of .ini files on success. Each comma is
followed by a newline. If the directive --with-config-file-scan-dir wasn't
set, FALSE is returned. If it was set and the directory was empty, an empty
string is returned. If a file is unrecognizable, the file will still make it
into the returned string but a PHP error will also result. This PHP error will
be seen both at compile time and while using |php_ini_scanned_files|.

A simple example to list the returned ini files

<?php >
  if ($filelist = php_ini_scanned_files()) {
      if (strlen($filelist) > 0) {
          $files = explode(',', $filelist);
  
          foreach ($files as $file) {
              echo "<li>" . trim($file) . "</li>\n";
          }
      }
  }
?>
