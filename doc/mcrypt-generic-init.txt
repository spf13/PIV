mcrypt_generic_init -- This function initializes all buffers needed for
encryption

  int mcrypt_generic_init(resource td, string key, string iv)~

You need to call this function before every call to |mcrypt_generic| or
|mdecrypt_generic|.

{td} The encryption descriptor.

{key} The maximum length of the key should be the one obtained by calling
|mcrypt_enc_get_key_size| and every value smaller than this is legal.

{iv} The IV should normally have the size of the algorithms block size, but
you must obtain the size by calling |mcrypt_enc_get_iv_size|. IV is ignored in
ECB. IV MUST exist in CFB, CBC, STREAM, nOFB and OFB modes. It needs to be
random and unique (but not secret). The same IV must be used for
encryption/decryption. If you do not want to use it you should set it to
zeros, but this is not recommended.

The function returns a negative value on error, -3 when the key length was
incorrect, -4 when there was a memory allocation problem and any other return
value is an unknown error. If an error occurs a warning will be displayed
accordingly. FALSE is returned if incorrect parameters were passed.
