odbc_execute -- Execute a prepared statement

  bool odbc_execute(resource result_id [, array parameters_array])~

Executes a statement prepared with |odbc_prepare|.

{result_id} The result id resource, from |odbc_prepare|.

{parameters_array} Parameters in {parameter_array} will be substituted for
placeholders in the prepared statement in order. Elements of this array will
be converted to strings by calling this function.

Any parameters in {parameter_array} which start and end with single quotes
will be taken as the name of a file to read and send to the database server as
the data for the appropriate placeholder.

If you wish to store a string which actually begins and ends with single
quotes, you must add a space or other non-single-quote character to the
beginning or end of the parameter, which will prevent the parameter from being
taken as a file name. If this is not an option, then you must use another
mechanism to store the string, such as executing the query directly with
|odbc_exec|).

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

|odbc_execute| and |odbc_prepare| example In the following code, $success will
only be TRUE if all three parameters to myproc are IN parameters:

<?php >
  $a = 1;
  $b = 2;
  $c = 3;
  $stmt    = odbc_prepare($conn, 'CALL myproc(?,?,?)');
  $success = odbc_execute($stmt, array($a, $b, $c));
?>



If you need to call a stored procedure using INOUT or OUT parameters, the
recommended workaround is to use a native extension for your database (for
example, mssql for MS SQL Server, or oci8 for Oracle).

Version Description 4.2.0 File reading is now subject to safe mode and
open-basedir restrictions in {parameters_array}. 4.1.1 Remote files are no
longer supported in {parameters_array}.
