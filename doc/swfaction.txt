SWFAction -- Creates a new Action

  SWFAction swfaction(string script)~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of
this function, and anything else documented about this function may change
without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own
risk.

|swfaction| creates a new Action, and compiles the given script into an
SWFAction object.

The script syntax is based on the C language, but with a lot taken out- the
SWF bytecode machine is just too simpleminded to do a lot of things we might
like. For instance, we can't implement function calls without a tremendous
amount of hackery because the jump bytecode has a hardcoded offset value. No
pushing your calling address to the stack and returning- every function would
have to know exactly where to return to.

So what's left? The compiler recognises the following tokens: break

for

continue

if

else

do

while

There is no typed data; all values in the SWF action machine are stored as
strings. The following functions can be used in expressions: time() Returns
the number of milliseconds (?) elapsed since the movie started.

random(seed) Returns a pseudo-random number in the range 0-seed.

length(expr) Returns the length of the given expression.

int(number) Returns the given number rounded down to the nearest integer.

concat(expr, expr) Returns the concatenation of the given expressions.

ord(expr) Returns the ASCII code for the given character

chr(num) Returns the character for the given ASCII code

substr(string, location, length) Returns the substring of length {length} at
location {location} of the given string {string}.

Additionally, the following commands may be used: duplicateClip(clip, name,
depth) Duplicate the named movie {clip} (aka sprite). The new movie clip has
name {name} and is at depth {depth}.

removeClip(expr) Removes the named movie clip.

trace(expr) Write the given expression to the trace log. Doubtful that the
browser plugin does anything with this.

startDrag(target, lock, [left, top, right, bottom]) Start dragging the movie
clip {target}. The {lock} argument indicates whether to lock the mouse (?)-
use 0 (FALSE) or 1 (TRUE). Optional parameters define a bounding area for the
dragging.

stopDrag() Stop dragging my heart around. And this movie clip, too.

callFrame(expr) Call the named frame as a function.

getURL(url, target, [method]) Load the given URL into the named target. The
{target} argument corresponds to HTML document targets (such as "_top" or
"_blank"). The optional {method} argument can be POST or GET if you want to
submit variables back to the server.

loadMovie(url, target) Load the given URL into the named target. The {target}
argument can be a frame name (I think), or one of the magical values
"_level0" (replaces current movie) or "_level1" (loads new movie on top of
current movie).

nextFrame() Go to the next frame.

prevFrame() Go to the last (or, rather, previous) frame.

play() Start playing the movie.

stop() Stop playing the movie.

toggleQuality() Toggle between high and low quality.

stopSounds() Stop playing all sounds.

gotoFrame(num) Go to frame number {num}. Frame numbers start at 0.

gotoFrame(name) Go to the frame named {name}. Which does a lot of good, since
I haven't added frame labels yet.

setTarget(expr) Sets the context for action. Or so they say- I really have no
idea what this does.

And there's one weird extra thing. The expression frameLoaded(num) can be used
in if statements and while loops to check if the given frame number has been
loaded yet. Well, it's supposed to, anyway, but I've never tested it and I
seriously doubt it actually works. You can just use /:framesLoaded instead.

Movie clips (all together now- aka sprites) have properties. You can read all
of them (or can you?), you can set some of them, and here they are: x

y

xScale

yScale

currentFrame - (read-only)

totalFrames - (read-only)

alpha - transparency level

visible - 1=on, 0=off (?)

width - (read-only)

height - (read-only)

rotation

target - (read-only) (???)

framesLoaded - (read-only)

name

dropTarget - (read-only) (???)

url - (read-only) (???)

highQuality - 1=high, 0=low (?)

focusRect - (???)

soundBufTime - (???)

So, setting a sprite's x position is as simple as /box.x = 100;. Why the slash
in front of the box, though? That's how flash keeps track of the sprites in
the movie, just like a Unix filesystem- here it shows that box is at the top
level. If the sprite named box had another sprite named biff inside of it,
you'd set its x position with /box/biff.x = 100;. At least, I think so;
correct me if I'm wrong here.

This simple example will move the red square across the window. |swfaction|
example

<?php >
    $s = new SWFShape();
    $f = $s->addFill(0xff, 0, 0);
    $s->setRightFill($f);
  
    $s->movePenTo(-500, -500);
    $s->drawLineTo(500, -500);
    $s->drawLineTo(500, 500);
    $s->drawLineTo(-500, 500);
    $s->drawLineTo(-500, -500);
  
    $p = new SWFSprite();
    $i = $p->add($s);
    $i->setDepth(1);
    $p->nextFrame();
  
    for ($n=0; $n<5; ++$n) {
      $i->rotate(-15);
      $p->nextFrame();
    }
  
    $m = new SWFMovie();
    $m->setBackground(0xff, 0xff, 0xff);
    $m->setDimension(6000, 4000);
  
    $i = $m->add($p);
    $i->setDepth(1);
    $i->moveTo(-500,2000);
    $i->setName("box");
  
    $m->add(new SWFAction("/box.x += 3;"));
    $m->nextFrame();
    $m->add(new SWFAction("gotoFrame(0); play();"));
    $m->nextFrame();

This simple example tracks down your mouse on the screen. |swfaction| example

    "));
  
    /* might as well turn off antialiasing, since these are just squares. */
  
    $m->add(new SWFAction("
      this.quality = 0;
    "));
  
    /* morphing box */
    $r = new SWFMorph();
    $s = $r->getShape1();
  
    /* Note this is backwards from normal shapes.  No idea why. */

       this is just a timeline w/ the box morphing */
  
    $box = new SWFSprite();
    $box->add(new SWFAction("
      stop();
    "));
    $i = $box->add($r);
  
    for ($n=0; $n<=20; ++$n) {
      $i->setRatio($n/20);
      $box->nextFrame();

    $i = $cell->add($box);
    $i->setName('box');
  
    $cell->add(new SWFAction("
  
      setTarget('box');
  
      /* ...x means the x coordinate of the parent, i.e. (..).x */
      dx = (/mouse.x + random(6)-3 - ...x)/5;
      dy = (/mouse.y + random(6)-3 - ...y)/5;
      gotoFrame(int(dx*dx + dy*dy));
  
    "));
  
    $cell->nextFrame();
    $cell->add(new SWFAction("
  
      gotoFrame(0);
      play();
  
    "));
  
    $cell->nextFrame();
  
    /* finally, add a bunch of the cells to the movie */
  
    for ($x=0; $x<12; ++$x) {

        $i = $m->add($cell);
