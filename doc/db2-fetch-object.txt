db2_fetch_object -- Returns an object with properties representing columns in
the fetched row

  object db2_fetch_object(resource stmt [, int row_number])~

Returns an object in which each property represents a column returned in the
row fetched from a result set.

{stmt} A valid stmt resource containing a result set.

{row_number} Requests a specific 1-indexed row from the result set. Passing
this parameter results in a PHP warning if the result set uses a forward-only
cursor.

Returns an object representing a single row in the result set. The properties
of the object map to the names of the columns in the result set.

The IBM DB2, Cloudscape, and Apache Derby database servers typically fold
column names to upper-case, so the object properties will reflect that case.

If your SELECT statement calls a scalar function to modify the value of a
column, the database servers return the column number as the name of the
column in the result set. If you prefer a more descriptive column name and
object property, you can use the AS clause to assign a name to the column in
the result set.

Returns FALSE if no row was retrieved.

A |db2_fetch_object| example The following example issues a SELECT statement
with a scalar function, RTRIM, that removes whitespace from the end of the
column. Rather than creating an object with the properties "BREED" and "2", we
use the AS clause in the SELECT statement to assign the name "name" to the
modified column. The database server folds the column names to upper-case,
resulting in an object with the properties "BREED" and "NAME".

<?php >
  $conn = db2_connect($database, $user, $password);
  
  $sql = "SELECT breed, RTRIM(name) AS name
      FROM animals
      WHERE id = ?";
  
  if ($conn) {
      $stmt = db2_prepare($conn, $sql);
      db2_execute($stmt, array(0));
  
      while ($pet = db2_fetch_object($stmt)) {
          echo "Come here, {$pet->NAME}, my little {$pet->BREED}!";
      }
      db2_close($conn);
  }
?>

The above example will output:

  Come here, Pook, my little cat!
