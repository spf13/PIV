dbase_create -- Creates a database

  int dbase_create(string filename, array fields)~

|dbase_create| creates a dBase database with the given definition.

When safe mode is enabled, PHP checks whether the files or directories being
operated upon have the same UID (owner) as the script that is being executed.

This function is affected by open_basedir.

{filename} The name of the database. It can be a relative or absolute path to
the file where dBase will store your data.

{fields} An array of arrays, each array describing the format of one field of
the database. Each field consists of a name, a character indicating the field
type, and optionally, a length, and a precision.

The fieldnames are limited in length and must not exceed 10 chars.

Returns a database link identifier if the database is successfully created, or
FALSE if an error occurred.

  // database "definition"

    array("date",     "D"),
    array("name",     "C",  50),
    array("age",      "N",   3, 0),
    array("email",    "C", 128),
    array("ismember", "L")
  );

  if (!dbase_create('/tmp/test.dbf', $def)) {
