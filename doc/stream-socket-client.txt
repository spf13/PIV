stream_socket_client -- Open Internet or Unix domain socket connection

  resource stream_socket_client(string remote_socket [, int errno [, string errstr [, float timeout [, int flags [, resource context]]]]])~

Initiates a stream or datagram connection to the destination specified by
{remote_socket}. The type of socket created is determined by the transport
specified using standard URL formatting: transport://target. For Internet
Domain sockets (AF_INET) such as TCP and UDP, the target portion of the
{remote_socket} parameter should consist of a hostname or IP address followed
by a colon and a port number. For Unix domain sockets, the {target} portion
should point to the socket file on the filesystem.

The stream will by default be opened in blocking mode. You can switch it to
non-blocking mode by using |stream_set_blocking|.

{remote_socket} Address to the socket to connect to.

{errno} Will be set to the system level error number if connection fails.

{errstr} Will be set to the system level error message if the connection
fails.

{timeout} Number of seconds until the connect() system call should timeout.
This parameter only applies when not making asynchronous connection attempts.

To set a timeout for reading/writing data over the socket, use the
|stream_set_timeout|, as the {timeout} only applies while making connecting
the socket.

{flags} Bitmask field which may be set to any combination of connection flags.
Currently the select of connection flags is limited to STREAM_CLIENT_CONNECT
(default), STREAM_CLIENT_ASYNC_CONNECT and STREAM_CLIENT_PERSISTENT.

{context} A valid context resource created with |stream_context_create|.

On success a stream resource is returned which may be used together with the
other file functions (such as |fgets|, |fgetss|, |fwrite|, |fclose|, and
|feof|), FALSE on failure.

On failure the {errno} and {errstr} arguments will be populated with the
actual system level error that occurred in the system-level connect() call. If
the value returned in {errno} is 0 and the function returned FALSE, it is an
indication that the error occurred before the connect() call. This is most
likely due to a problem initializing the socket. Note that the {errno} and
{errstr} arguments will always be passed by reference.

|stream_socket_client| example

<?php >
  $fp = stream_socket_client("tcp://www.example.com:80", $errno, $errstr, 30);
  if (!$fp) {
      echo "$errstr ($errno)<br />\n";
  } else {
      fwrite($fp, "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\nHost: www.example.com\r\nAccept: */*\r\n\r\n");
      while (!feof($fp)) {
          echo fgets($fp, 1024);
      }
      fclose($fp);
  }
?>



Using UDP connection Retrieving the day and time from the UDP service
"daytime" (port 13) on localhost.

<?php >
  $fp = stream_socket_client("udp://127.0.0.1:13", $errno, $errstr);
  if (!$fp) {
      echo "ERROR: $errno - $errstr<br />\n";
  } else {
      fwrite($fp, "\n");
      echo fread($fp, 26);
      fclose($fp);
  }
?>



UDP sockets will sometimes appear to have opened without an error, even if the
remote host is unreachable. The error will only become apparent when you read
or write data to/from the socket. The reason for this is because UDP is a
"connectionless" protocol, which means that the operating system does not try
to establish a link for the socket until it actually needs to send or receive
data.

When specifying a numerical IPv6 address (e.g. fe80::1), you must enclose the
IP in square bracketsâfor example, tcp://[fe80::1]:80.

Depending on the environment, the Unix domain or the optional connect timeout
may not be available. A list of available transports can be retrieved using
|stream_get_transports|. See for a list of built in transports.
