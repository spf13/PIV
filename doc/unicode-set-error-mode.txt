unicode_set_error_mode -- Set the error mode for strings conversions

  bool unicode_set_error_mode(int direction, int mode)~

This function sets the error mode for string conversions between different
encodings. An error can occur during conversion when an illegal character is
encountered or if a character cannot be represented into the new encoding. By
default, when an error is encountered, the conversion stops.

{direction} The {direction} sets the conversion direction to which the error
mode will apply. This can either be FROM_UNICODE, which will set the error
mode for conversions from a unicode string to a binary string or TO_UNICODE,
which will set the error mode for conversions from a binary string to a
unicode string.

{mode} {mode} determines how the conversion errors are handled. It should be
one of the following constants:

Available modes Mode Description U_CONV_ERROR_STOP Stop the conversion. This
is the default mode. U_CONV_ERROR_SKIP Skip the character. U_CONV_ERROR_SUBST
Substitute the character. The substituting character can be set with
|unicode_set_subst_char|. U_CONV_ERROR_ESCAPE_UNICODE Escape the faulty bytes
and represent them in the Unicode character format. U_CONV_ERROR_ESCAPE_ICU
Escape the faulty bytes and represent them in the ICU character format.
U_CONV_ERROR_ESCAPE_JAVA Escape the faulty bytes and print them in the Java
character format. U_CONV_ERROR_ESCAPE_XML_DEC Escape the faulty bytes and
represent them in decimal format. U_CONV_ERROR_ESCAPE_XML_HEX Escape the
faulty bytes and represent them in hexadecimal format.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

Emits a E_WARNING level error if the direction or the mode are invalid.

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.
