socket_create -- Create a socket (endpoint for communication)

  resource socket_create(int domain, int type, int protocol)~

Creates and returns a socket resource, also referred to as an endpoint of
communication. A typical network connection is made up of 2 sockets, one
performing the role of the client, and another performing the role of the
server.

{domain} The {domain} parameter specifies the protocol family to be used by
the socket.

Available address/protocol families Domain Description AF_INET IPv4 Internet
based protocols. TCP and UDP are common protocols of this protocol family.
AF_INET6 IPv6 Internet based protocols. TCP and UDP are common protocols of
this protocol family. AF_UNIX Local communication protocol family. High
efficiency and low overhead make it a great form of IPC (Interprocess
Communication). {type} The {type} parameter selects the type of communication
to be used by the socket.

Available socket types Type Description SOCK_STREAM Provides sequenced,
reliable, full-duplex, connection-based byte streams. An out-of-band data
transmission mechanism may be supported. The TCP protocol is based on this
socket type. SOCK_DGRAM Supports datagrams (connectionless, unreliable
messages of a fixed maximum length). The UDP protocol is based on this socket
type. SOCK_SEQPACKET Provides a sequenced, reliable, two-way connection-based
data transmission path for datagrams of fixed maximum length; a consumer is
required to read an entire packet with each read call. SOCK_RAW Provides raw
network protocol access. This special type of socket can be used to manually
construct any type of protocol. A common use for this socket type is to
perform ICMP requests (like ping, traceroute, etc). SOCK_RDM Provides a
reliable datagram layer that does not guarantee ordering. This is most likely
not implemented on your operating system. {protocol} The {protocol} parameter
sets the specific protocol within the specified {domain} to be used when
communicating on the returned socket. The proper value can be retrieved by
name by using |getprotobyname|. If the desired protocol is TCP, or UDP the
corresponding constants SOL_TCP, and SOL_UDP can also be used.

Common protocols Name Description icmp The Internet Control Message Protocol
is used primarily by gateways and hosts to report errors in datagram
communication. The "ping" command (present in most modern operating systems)
is an example application of ICMP. udp The User Datagram Protocol is a
connectionless, unreliable, protocol with fixed record lengths. Due to these
aspects, UDP requires a minimum amount of protocol overhead. tcp The
Transmission Control Protocol is a reliable, connection based, stream
oriented, full duplex protocol. TCP guarantees that all data packets will be
received in the order in which they were sent. If any packet is somehow lost
during communication, TCP will automatically retransmit the packet until the
destination host acknowledges that packet. For reliability and performance
reasons, the TCP implementation itself decides the appropriate octet
boundaries of the underlying datagram communication layer. Therefore, TCP
applications must allow for the possibility of partial record transmission.

|socket_create| returns a socket resource on success, or FALSE on error. The
actual error code can be retrieved by calling |socket_last_error|. This error
code may be passed to |socket_strerror| to get a textual explanation of the
error.

Version Description 5.0.0 The AF_INET6 constant was added.

If an invalid {domain} or {type} is given, |socket_create| defaults to AF_INET
and SOCK_STREAM respectively and additionally emits an E_WARNING message.
