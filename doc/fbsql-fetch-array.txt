fbsql_fetch_array -- Fetch a result row as an associative array, a numeric
array, or both

  array fbsql_fetch_array(resource result [, int result_type])~

Returns an array that corresponds to the fetched row, or FALSE if there are no
more rows.

|fbsql_fetch_array| is an extended version of |fbsql_fetch_row|. In addition
to storing the data in the numeric indices of the result array, it also
stores the data in associative indices, using the field names as keys.

If two or more columns of the result have the same field names, the last
column will take precedence. To access the other column(s) of the same name,
you must the numeric index of the column or make an alias for the column.

  select t1.f1 as foo t2.f1 as bar from t1, t2

An important thing to note is that using |fbsql_fetch_array| is NOT
significantly slower than using |fbsql_fetch_row|, while it provides a
significant added value.

The optional second argument {result_type} in |fbsql_fetch_array| is a
constant and can take the following values: FBSQL_ASSOC, FBSQL_NUM, and
FBSQL_BOTH.

For further details, see also |fbsql_fetch_row| and |fbsql_fetch_assoc|.

|fbsql_fetch_array| example

<?php >
  fbsql_connect($host, $user, $password);
  $result = fbsql_db_query("database", "select user_id, fullname from table");
  while ($row = fbsql_fetch_array($result)) {
      echo "user_id: " . $row["user_id"] . "<br />\n";
      echo "user_id: " . $row[0] . "<br />\n";
      echo "fullname: " . $row["fullname"] . "<br />\n";
      echo "fullname: " . $row[1] . "<br />\n";
  }
  fbsql_free_result($result);
?>
