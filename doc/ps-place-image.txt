ps_place_image -- Places image on the page

  bool ps_place_image(resource psdoc, int imageid, float x, float y, float scale)~

Places a formerly loaded image on the page. The image can be scaled. If the
image shall be rotated as well, you will have to rotate the coordinate system
before with |ps_rotate|.

{psdoc} Resource identifier of the postscript file as returned by |ps_new|.

{imageid} The resource identifier of the image as returned by |ps_open_image|
or |ps_open_image_file|.

{x} x-coordinate of the lower left corner of the image.

{y} y-coordinate of the lower left corner of the image.

{scale} The scaling factor for the image. A scale of 1.0 will result in a
resolution of 72 dpi, because each pixel is equivalent to 1 point.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
