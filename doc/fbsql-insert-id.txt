fbsql_insert_id -- Get the id generated from the previous INSERT operation

  int fbsql_insert_id([resource link_identifier])~

Gets the id generated from the previous INSERT operation which created a
DEFAULT UNIQUE value.

The value of the FrontBase SQL function |fbsql_insert_id| always contains the
most recently generated DEFAULT UNIQUE value, and is not reset between
queries.

{ link_identifier}A FrontBase link identifier returned by |fbsql_connect| or
|fbsql_pconnect|.

If optional and not specified, the function will try to find an open link to
the FrontBase server and if no such link is found it will try to create one as
if |fbsql_connect| was called with no arguments.

Returns the ID generated from the previous INSERT query, or 0 if the previous
query does not generate an DEFAULT UNIQUE value.

If you need to save the value for later, be sure to call this function
immediately after the query that generates the value.
