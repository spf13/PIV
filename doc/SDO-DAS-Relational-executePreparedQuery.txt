SDO_DAS_Relational::executePreparedQuery -- Executes an SQL query passed as a
prepared statement, with a list of values to substitute for placeholders, and
return the results as a normalised data graph.

  SDODataObject SDO_DAS_Relational::executePreparedQuery(PDO database_handle, PDOStatement prepared_statement, array value_list [, array column_specifier])~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

Executes a given query against the relational database, using the supplied PDO
database handle. Differs from the simpler |executeQuery| in that it takes a
prepared statement and a list of values. This is the appropriate call to use
either when the statement is to executed a number of times with different
arguments, and there is therefore a performance benefit to be had from
preparing the statement only once, or when the the SQL statement is to contain
varying values taken from a source that cannot be completely trusted. In this
latter case it may be unsafe to construct the SQL statement by simply
concatenating the parts of the statement together, since the values may
contain pieces of SQL. To guard against this, a so-called SQL injection
attack, it is safer to prepare the SQL statement with placeholders (also known
as parameter markers, denoted by '?') and supply a list of the values to be
substituted as a separate argument. Otherwise this function is the same as
|executeQuery| in that it uses the model that it built from the the metadata
to interpret the result set and returns a data graph.

PDO_database_handle Constructed using the PDO extension. A typical line to
construct a PDO database handle might look like this:

  $dbh = new PDO("mysql:dbname=COMPANYDB;host=localhost",DATABASE_USER,DATABASE_PASSWORD);



prepared_statement A prepared SQL statement to be executed against the
database. This will have been prepared by PDO's |prepare| method.

value_list An array of the values to be substituted into the SQL statement in
place of the placeholders. In the event that there are no placeholders or
parameter markers in the SQL statement then this argument can be specified as
NULL or as an empty array;

column_specifier The Relational DAS needs to examine the result set and for
every column, know which table and which column of that table it came from. In
some circumstances it can find this information for itself, but sometimes it
cannot. In these cases a column specifier is needed, which is an array that
identifies the columns. Each entry in the array is simply a string in the form
table-name.column_name.

The column specifier is needed when there are duplicate column names in the
database metadata, For example, in the database used within the examples, all
the tables have both a id and a name column. When the Relational DAS fetches
the result set from PDO it can do so with the PDO_FETCH_ASSOC attribute, which
will cause the columns in the results set to be labelled with the column name,
but will not distinguish duplicates. So this will only work when there are no
duplicates possible in the results set.

To summarise, specify a column specifier array whenever there is any
uncertainty about which column could be from which table and only omit it when
every column name in the database metadata is unique.

All of the examples in the Examples use a column specifier. There is one
example in the Scenarios directory of the installation that does not: that
which works with just the employee table, and because it works with just one
table, there can not exist duplicate column names.

Returns a data graph. Specifically, it returns a root object of a special
type. Under this root object will be the data from the result set. The root
object will have a multi-valued containment property with the same name as the
application root type specified on the constructor, and that property will
contain one or more data objects of the application root type.

In the event that the query returns no data, the special root object will
still be returned but the containment property for the application root type
will be empty.

|SDO_DAS_Relational::executePreparedQuery| can throw an
SDO_DAS_Relational_Exception if it is unable to construct the data graph
correctly. This can occur for a number of reasons: for example if it finds
that it does not have primary keys in the result set for all the objects. It
also catches any PDO exceptions and obtains PDO diagnostic information which
it includes in an SDO_DAS_Relational_Exception which it then throws.

Retrieving a data object using |executePreparedQuery| In this example a single
data object is retrieved from the database - or possibly more than one if
there is more than one company called 'Acme'. For each company returned, the
name and id properties are echoed.

Other examples of the use of |executePreparedQuery| can be found in the
example code supplied in sdo/DAS/Relational/Scenarios .
