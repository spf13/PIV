addcslashes -- Quote string with slashes in a C style

  string addcslashes(string str, string charlist)~

Returns a string with backslashes before characters that are listed in
{charlist} parameter.

{str} The string to be escaped.

{charlist} A list of characters to be escaped. If {charlist} contains
characters \n, \r etc., they are converted in C-like style, while other
non-alphanumeric characters with ASCII codes lower than 32 and higher than 126
converted to octal representation.

When you define a sequence of characters in the charlist argument make sure
that you know what characters come between the characters that you set as the
start and end of the range.

<?php >
  echo addcslashes('foo[ ]', 'A..z');
  // output:  \f\o\o\[ \]
  // All upper and lower-case letters will be escaped
  // ... but so will the [\]^_`
?>

Also, if the first character in a range has a higher ASCII value than the
second character in the range, no range will be constructed. Only the start,
end and period characters will be escaped. Use the |ord| function to find the
ASCII value for a character.

<?php >
  echo addcslashes("zoo['.']", 'z..A');
  // output:  \zoo['\.']
?>

Be careful if you choose to escape characters 0, a, b, f, n, r, t and v. They
will be converted to \0, \a, \b, \f, \n, \r, \t and \v. In PHP \0 (NULL), \r
(carriage return), \n (newline), \f (form feed), \v (vertical tab) and \t
(tab) are predefined escape sequences, while in C all of these are predefined
escape sequences.

Returns the escaped string.

Version Description 5.2.5 The escape sequences \v and \f were added.

{charlist} like "\0..\37", which would escape all characters with ASCII code
between 0 and 31. |addcslashes| example

<?php >
  $escaped = addcslashes($not_escaped, "\0..\37!@\177..\377");
?>
