posix_access -- Determine accessibility of a file

  bool posix_access(string file [, int mode])~

|posix_access| checks the user's permission of a file.

{file} The name of the file to be tested.

{mode} A mask consisting of one or more of POSIX_F_OK, POSIX_R_OK, POSIX_W_OK
and POSIX_X_OK. Defaults to POSIX_F_OK.

POSIX_R_OK, POSIX_W_OK and POSIX_X_OK request checking whether the file exists
and has read, write and execute permissions, respectively. POSIX_F_OK just
requests checking for the existence of the file.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

|posix_access| example This example will check if the $file is readable and
writable, otherwise will print an error message.

<?php >
  $file = 'some_file';
  
  if (posix_access($file, POSIX_R_OK | POSIX_W_OK)) {
      echo 'The file is readable and writable!';
  
  } else {
      $error = posix_get_last_error();
  
      echo "Error $error: " . posix_strerror($error);
  }
?>



When safe mode is enabled, PHP checks whether the files or directories being
operated upon have the same UID (owner) as the script that is being executed.
