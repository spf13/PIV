PDO::sqliteCreateAggregate -- Registers an aggregating User Defined Function
for use in SQL statements

  bool sqliteCreateAggregate(string function_name, callback step_func, callback finalize_func [, int num_args])~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

This method is similar to except that it registers functions that can be used
to calculate a result aggregated across all the rows of a query.

The key difference between this method and is that two functions are required
to manage the aggregate.

{function_name} The name of the function used in SQL statements.

{step_func} Callback function called for each row of the result set. Your PHP
function should accumulate the result and store it in the aggregation context.

  bool (string function_name, callback step_func, callback finalize_func [, int num_args, mixed context, int rownumber, mixed value1 [, mixed value2 [, mixed ..]]])~

This function need to be defined as:

context will be NULL for the first row; on subsequent rows it will have the
value that was previously returned from the step function; you should use this
to maintain the aggregate state.

rownumber will hold the current row number.

{finalize_func} Callback function to aggregate the "stepped" data from each
row. Once all the rows have been processed, this function will be called and
it should then take the data from the aggregation context and return the
result. Callback functions should return a type understood by SQLite (i.e.
scalar type).

  bool (string function_name, callback step_func, callback finalize_func [, int num_args, mixed context, int rownumber, mixed value1 [, mixed value2 [, mixed .., mixed context, int rownumber]]])~

This function need to be defined as:

context will hold the return value from the very last call to the step
function.

rownumber will hold the number of rows over which the aggregate was performed.

The return value of this function will be used as the return value for the
aggregate.

{num_args} Hint to the SQLite parser if the callback function accepts a
predetermined number of arguments.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

max_length aggregation function example

<?php >
  $data = array(
     'one',
     'two',
     'three',
     'four',
     'five',
     'six',
     'seven',
     'eight',
     'nine',
     'ten',
     );
  $db = new PDO('sqlite::memory:');
  $db->exec("CREATE TABLE strings(a)");
  $insert = $db->prepare('INSERT INTO strings VALUES (?)');
  foreach ($data as $str) {
      $insert->execute(array($str));
  }
  $insert = null;
  
  function max_len_step(&amp;$context, $rownumber, $string) 
  {
      if (strlen($string) > $context) {
          $context = strlen($string);
      }
  	return $context;
  }
  
  function max_len_finalize(&amp;$context, $rownumber) 
  {
      return $context;
  }
  
  $db->sqliteCreateAggregate('max_len', 'max_len_step', 'max_len_finalize');
  
  var_dump($db->query('SELECT max_len(a) from strings')->fetchAll());
?>





In this example, we are creating an aggregating function that will calculate
the length of the longest string in one of the columns of the table. For each
row, the max_len_step function is called and passed a {context} parameter. The
context parameter is just like any other PHP variable and be set to hold an
array or even an object value. In this example, we are simply using it to hold
the maximum length we have seen so far; if the {string} has a length longer
than the current maximum, we update the context to hold this new maximum
length.

After all of the rows have been processed, SQLite calls the max_len_finalize
function to determine the aggregate result. Here, we could perform some kind
of calculation based on the data found in the {context}. In our simple example
though, we have been calculating the result as the query progressed, so we
simply need to return the context value.

It is NOT recommended for you to store a copy of the values in the context and
then process them at the end, as you would cause SQLite to use a lot of memory
to process the query - just think of how much memory you would need if a
million rows were stored in memory, each containing a string 32 bytes in
length.

You can use and to override SQLite native SQL functions.

This method is not available with the SQLite2 driver. Use the old style sqlite
API for that instead.
