ob_start -- Turn on output buffering

  bool ob_start([callback output_callback [, int chunk_size [, bool erase]]])~

This function will turn output buffering on. While output buffering is active
no output is sent from the script (other than headers), instead the output is
stored in an internal buffer.

The contents of this internal buffer may be copied into a string variable
using |ob_get_contents|. To output what is stored in the internal buffer, use
|ob_end_flush|. Alternatively, |ob_end_clean| will silently discard the buffer
contents.

Some web servers (e.g. Apache) change the working directory of a script when
calling the callback function. You can change it back by e.g.
chdir(dirname($_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME'])) in the callback function.

Output buffers are stackable, that is, you may call |ob_start| while another
|ob_start| is active. Just make sure that you call |ob_end_flush| the
appropriate number of times. If multiple output callback functions are active,
output is being filtered sequentially through each of them in nesting order.

{output_callback} An optional {output_callback} function may be specified.
This function takes a string as a parameter and should return a string. The
function will be called when the output buffer is flushed (sent) or cleaned
(with |ob_flush|, |ob_clean| or similar function) or when the output buffer is
flushed to the browser at the end of the request. When {output_callback} is
called, it will receive the contents of the output buffer as its parameter and
is expected to return a new output buffer as a result, which will be sent to
the browser. If the {output_callback} is not a callable function, this
function will return FALSE.

If the callback function has two parameters, the second parameter is filled
with a bit-field consisting of PHP_OUTPUT_HANDLER_START,
PHP_OUTPUT_HANDLER_CONT and PHP_OUTPUT_HANDLER_END.

If {output_callback} returns FALSE original input is sent to the browser.

The {output_callback} parameter may be bypassed by passing a NULL value.

|ob_end_clean|, |ob_end_flush|, |ob_clean|, |ob_flush| and |ob_start| may not
be called from a callback function. If you call them from callback function,
the behavior is undefined. If you would like to delete the contents of a
buffer, return "" (a null string) from callback function. You can't even call
functions using the output buffering functions like print_r($expression, true)
or highlight_file($filename, true) from a callback function.

In PHP 4.0.4, |ob_gzhandler| was introduced to facilitate sending gz-encoded
data to web browsers that support compressed web pages. |ob_gzhandler|
determines what type of content encoding the browser will accept and will
return its output accordingly.

{chunk_size} If the optional parameter {chunk_size} is passed, the buffer will
be flushed after any output call which causes the buffer's length to equal or
exceed {chunk_size}. Default value 0 means that the function is called only in
the end, other special value 1 sets {chunk_size} to 4096.

{erase} If the optional parameter {erase} is set to FALSE, the buffer will not
be deleted until the script finishes.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

Version Description 4.3.2 This function was changed to return FALSE in case
the passed {output_callback} can not be executed. 4.2.0 Added the {erase}
parameter.

User defined callback function example

<?php >
  function callback($buffer)
  {
    // replace all the apples with oranges
    return (str_replace("apples", "oranges", $buffer));
  }
  
  ob_start("callback");
?>
  <html>
  <body>
  <p>It's like comparing apples to oranges.</p>
  </body>
  </html>
<?php >
  ob_end_flush();
?>

The above example will output:

  <html>
  <body>
  <p>It's like comparing oranges to oranges.</p>
  </body>
  </html>
