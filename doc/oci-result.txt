Returns the data from {field} in the current row, fetched by |oci_fetch|.

{statement}

{field} Can be either use the column number (1-based) or the column name (in
uppercase).

Returns everything as strings except for abstract types (ROWIDs, LOBs and
FILEs). Returns FALSE on error.

In PHP versions before 5.0.0 you must use |ociresult| instead. This name still
can be used, it was left as alias of |oci_result| for downwards compatability.
This, however, is deprecated and not recommended.
