pg_end_copy -- Sync with PostgreSQL backend

  bool pg_end_copy([resource connection])~

|pg_end_copy| syncs the PostgreSQL frontend (usually a web server process)
with the PostgreSQL server after doing a copy operation performed by
|pg_put_line|. |pg_end_copy| must be issued, otherwise the PostgreSQL server
may get out of sync with the frontend and will report an error.

{connection} PostgreSQL database connection resource. When {connection} is not
present, the default connection is used. The default connection is the last
connection made by |pg_connect| or |pg_pconnect|.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

|pg_end_copy| example

<?php >
    $conn = pg_pconnect("dbname=foo");
    pg_query($conn, "create table bar (a int4, b char(16), d float8)");
    pg_query($conn, "copy bar from stdin");
    pg_put_line($conn, "3\thello world\t4.5\n");
    pg_put_line($conn, "4\tgoodbye world\t7.11\n");
    pg_put_line($conn, "\\.\n");
    pg_end_copy($conn);
