array_push -- Push one or more elements onto the end of array

  int array_push(array array, mixed var [, mixed ...])~

|array_push| treats {array} as a stack, and pushes the passed variables onto
the end of {array}. The length of {array} increases by the number of variables
pushed. Has the same effect as:

<?php >
  $array[] = $var;
?>

repeated for each {var}.

If you use |array_push| to add one element to the array it's better to use
$array[] = because in that way there is no overhead of calling a function.

|array_push| will raise a warning if the first argument is not an array. This
differs from the $var[] behaviour where a new array is created.

{array} The input array.

{var} The pushed value.

Returns the new number of elements in the array.

|array_push| example

<?php >
  $stack = array("orange", "banana");
  array_push($stack, "apple", "raspberry");
  print_r($stack);
?>

The above example will output:

  Array
  (
      [0] => orange
      [1] => banana
      [2] => apple
      [3] => raspberry
  )



|array_pop| |array_shift| |array_unshift|
