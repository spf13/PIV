scandir -- List files and directories inside the specified path

  array scandir(string directory [, int sorting_order [, resource context]])~

Returns an array of files and directories from the {directory}.

{directory} The directory that will be scanned.

{sorting_order} By default, the sorted order is alphabetical in ascending
order. If the optional {sorting_order} is set to non-zero, then the sort order
is alphabetical in descending order.

{context} For a description of the {context} parameter, refer to the streams
section of the manual.

Returns an array of filenames on success, or FALSE on failure. If {directory}
is not a directory, then boolean FALSE is returned, and an error of level
E_WARNING is generated.

A simple |scandir| example

<?php >
  $dir    = '/tmp';
  $files1 = scandir($dir);
  $files2 = scandir($dir, 1);
  
  print_r($files1);
  print_r($files2);
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  Array
  (
      [0] => .
      [1] => ..
      [2] => bar.php
      [3] => foo.txt
      [4] => somedir
  )
  Array
  (
      [0] => somedir
      [1] => foo.txt
      [2] => bar.php
      [3] => ..
      [4] => .
  )



PHP 4 alternatives to |scandir|

<?php >
  $dir = "/tmp";
  $dh  = opendir($dir);
  while (false !== ($filename = readdir($dh))) {
      $files[] = $filename;
  }
  
  sort($files);
  
  print_r($files);
  
  rsort($files);
  
  print_r($files);
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  Array
  (
      [0] => .
      [1] => ..
      [2] => bar.php
      [3] => foo.txt
      [4] => somedir
  )
  Array
  (
      [0] => somedir
      [1] => foo.txt
      [2] => bar.php
      [3] => ..
      [4] => .
  )



A URL can be used as a filename with this function if the fopen wrappers have
been enabled. See |fopen| for more details on how to specify the filename and
for a list of supported URL protocols.
