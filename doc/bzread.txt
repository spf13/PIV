bzread -- Binary safe bzip2 file read

  string bzread(resource bz [, int length])~

|bzread| reads from the given bzip2 file pointer.

Reading stops when {length} (uncompressed) bytes have been read or EOF is
reached, whichever comes first.

{bz} The file pointer. It must be valid and must point to a file successfully
opened by |bzopen|.

{length} If not specified, |bzread| will read 1024 (uncompressed) bytes at a
time.

Returns the uncompressed data, or FALSE on error.

|bzread| example

<?php >
  $file = "/tmp/foo.bz2";
  $bz = bzopen($file, "r") or die("Couldn't open $file");
  
  $decompressed_file = '';
  while (!feof($bz)) {
    $decompressed_file .= bzread($bz, 4096);
  }
  bzclose($bz);
  
  echo "The contents of $file are: <br />\n";
  echo $decompressed_file;
?>
