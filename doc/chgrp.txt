Changing a file's group

<?php >
  $filename = 'shared_file.txt';
  $format = "%s's Group ID @ %s: %d\n";

This function will not work on remote files as the file to be examined must be
accessible via the server"s filesystem.

When safe mode is enabled, PHP checks whether the files or directories being
operated upon have the same UID (owner) as the script that is being executed.
