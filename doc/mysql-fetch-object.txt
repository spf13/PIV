mysql_fetch_object -- Fetch a result row as an object

  object mysql_fetch_object(resource result [, string class_name [, array params]])~

Returns an object with properties that correspond to the fetched row and moves
the internal data pointer ahead.

{ result}The result resource that is being evaluated. This result comes from a
call to |mysql_query|.

{class_name} The name of the class to instantiate, set the properties of and
return. If not specified, a stdClass object is returned.

{params} An optional array of parameters to pass to the constructor for
{class_name} objects.

Returns an object with string properties that correspond to the fetched row,
or FALSE if there are no more rows.

|mysql_fetch_row| fetches one row of data from the result associated with the
specified result identifier. The row is returned as an array. Each result
column is stored in an array offset, starting at offset 0.

Version Description 5.0.0 Added the ability to return as a different object.

|mysql_fetch_object| example

<?php >
  mysql_connect("hostname", "user", "password");
  mysql_select_db("mydb");
  $result = mysql_query("select * from mytable");
  while ($row = mysql_fetch_object($result)) {
      echo $row->user_id;
      echo $row->fullname;
  }
  mysql_free_result($result);
?>





|mysql_fetch_object| example

<?php >
  class foo {
      public $name;
  }
  
  mysql_connect("hostname", "user", "password");
  mysql_select_db("mydb");
  
  $result = mysql_query("select name from mytable limit 1");
  $obj = mysql_fetch_object($result, 'foo');
  var_dump($obj);
?>





Speed-wise, the function is identical to |mysql_fetch_array|, and almost as
quick as |mysql_fetch_row| (the difference is insignificant).

|mysql_fetch_object| is similar to |mysql_fetch_array|, with one difference -
an object is returned, instead of an array. Indirectly, that means that you
can only access the data by the field names, and not by their offsets (numbers
are illegal property names).

Field names returned by this function are case-sensitive.

This function sets NULL fields to the PHP NULL value.
