stream_set_write_buffer -- Sets file buffering on the given stream

  int stream_set_write_buffer(resource stream, int buffer)~

Sets the buffering for write operations on the given {stream} to {buffer}
bytes.

Output using |fwrite| is normally buffered at 8K. This means that if there are
two processes wanting to write to the same output stream (a file), each is
paused after 8K of data to allow the other to write.

{stream} The file pointer.

{buffer} The number of bytes to buffer. If {buffer} is 0 then write operations
are unbuffered. This ensures that all writes with |fwrite| are completed
before other processes are allowed to write to that output stream.

Returns 0 on success, or EOF if the request cannot be honored.

|stream_set_write_buffer| example The following example demonstrates how to
use |stream_set_write_buffer| to create an unbuffered stream.

<?php >
  $fp = fopen($file, "w");
  if ($fp) {
    stream_set_write_buffer($fp, 0);
    fwrite($fp, $output);
    fclose($fp);
  }
?>
