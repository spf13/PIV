  SDO_DAS_DataFactory SDO_DAS_DataFactory::getDataFactory()~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

Static method to get an instance of an SDO_DAS_DataFactory. This instance is
initially only configured with the basic SDO types. A Data Access Service is
responsible for populating the data factory model and then allowing PHP
applications to create SDOs based on the model through the SDO_DataFactory
interface. PHP applications should always obtain a data factory from a
configured Data Access Service, not through this interface.

None.

Returns an SDO_DAS_DataFactory.
