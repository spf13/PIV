array_diff_assoc -- Computes the difference of arrays with additional index
check

  array array_diff_assoc(array array1, array array2 [, array ...])~

Compares {array1} against {array2} and returns the difference. Unlike
|array_diff| the array keys are used in the comparison.

{array1} The array to compare from

{array2} An array to compare against

{...} More arrays to compare against

Returns an array containing all the values from {array1} that are not present
in any of the other arrays.

|array_diff_assoc| example In this example you see the "a" => "green" pair is
present in both arrays and thus it is not in the output from the function.
Unlike this, the pair 0 => "red" is in the output because in the second
argument "red" has key which is 1.

<?php >
  $array1 = array("a" => "green", "b" => "brown", "c" => "blue", "red");
  $array2 = array("a" => "green", "yellow", "red");
  $result = array_diff_assoc($array1, $array2);
  print_r($result);
?>

The above example will output:

  Array
  (
      [b] => brown
      [c] => blue
      [0] => red
  )



|array_diff_assoc| example Two values from key => value pairs are considered
equal only if (string) $elem1 === (string) $elem2 . In other words a strict
check takes place so the string representations must be the same.

<?php >
  $array1 = array(0, 1, 2);
  $array2 = array("00", "01", "2");
  $result = array_diff_assoc($array1, $array2);
  print_r($result);
?>

The above example will output:

  Array
  (
      [0] => 0
      [1] => 1
      )



This function only checks one dimension of a n-dimensional array. Of course
you can check deeper dimensions by using, for example,
array_diff_assoc($array1[0], $array2[0]);.
