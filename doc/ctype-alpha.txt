ctype_alpha -- Check for alphabetic character(s)

  bool ctype_alpha(string text)~

Checks if all of the characters in the provided string, {text}, are
alphabetic. In the standard C locale letters are just [A-Za-z] and
|ctype_alpha| is equivalent to (ctype_upper($text) || ctype_lower($text)) if
$text is just a single character, but other languages have letters that are
considered neither upper nor lower case.

{text} The tested string.

Returns TRUE if every character in {text} is a letter from the current locale,
FALSE otherwise.

A |ctype_alpha| example (using the default locale)

<?php >
  $strings = array('KjgWZC', 'arf12');
  foreach ($strings as $testcase) {
      if (ctype_alpha($testcase)) {
          echo "The string $testcase consists of all letters.\n";
      } else {
          echo "The string $testcase does not consist of all letters.\n";
      }
  }
?>

The above example will output:

  The string KjgWZC consists of all letters.
  The string arf12 does not consist of all letters.
