  object Swish->prepare([string query])~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

Prepare and return a search object, which you can later use for unlimited
number of queries.

{query} Optional query string. The query can be also set using
|SwishSearch->execute| method.

Returns SwishSearch object.

Throws SwishException on error.

Basic |Swish->prepare| example

<?php >
  try {
  
      $swish = new Swish("index.swish-e");
      $search = $swish->prepare("search query");
      $results = $search->execute();
      echo "Found: ", $results->hits, " hits\n";
  
      $results = $search->execute("new search");
  
      echo "Found: ", $results->hits, " hits\n";
  } catch (SwishException $e) {
      echo $e->getMessage(), "\n";
  }
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  Found: 2 hits
  Found: 5 hits
