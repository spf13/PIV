runkit_lint -- Check the PHP syntax of the specified php code

  bool runkit_lint(string code)~

The |runkit_lint| function performs a syntax (lint) check on the specified php
code testing for scripting errors. This is similar to using php -l from the
command line except |runkit_lint| accepts actual code rather than a filename.

Sandbox support (required for |runkit_lint|, |runkit_lint_file|, and the
Runkit_Sandbox class) is only available as of PHP 5.1.0 or specially patched
versions of PHP 5.0, and requires that thread safety be enabled. See the
README file included in the runkit package for more information.

{code} PHP Code to be lint checked

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
