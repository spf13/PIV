arsort -- Sort an array in reverse order and maintain index association

  bool arsort(array array [, int sort_flags])~

This function sorts an array such that array indices maintain their
correlation with the array elements they are associated with.

This is used mainly when sorting associative arrays where the actual element
order is significant.

{array} The input array.

{sort_flags} You may modify the behavior of the sort using the optional
parameter {sort_flags}, for details see |sort|.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

|arsort| example

<?php >
  $fruits = array("d" => "lemon", "a" => "orange", "b" => "banana", "c" => "apple");
  arsort($fruits);
  foreach ($fruits as $key => $val) {
      echo "$key = $val\n";
  }
?>

The above example will output:

  a = orange
  d = lemon
  b = banana
  c = apple

The fruits have been sorted in reverse alphabetical order, and the index
associated with each element has been maintained.
