mssql_select_db -- Select MS SQL database

  bool mssql_select_db(string database_name [, resource link_identifier])~

|mssql_select_db| sets the current active database on the server that's
associated with the specified link identifier.

Every subsequent call to |mssql_query| will be made on the active database.

{database_name} The database name.

To escape the name of a database that contains spaces, hyphens ("-"), or any
other exceptional characters, the database name must be enclosed in brackets,
as is shown in the example, below. This technique must also be applied when
selecting a database name that is also a reserved word (such as primary).

{link_identifier} A MS SQL link identifier, returned by |mssql_connect| or
|mssql_pconnect|.

If no link identifier is specified, the last opened link is assumed. If no
link is open, the function will try to establish a link as if |mssql_connect|
was called, and use it.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

|mssql_select_db| example

<?php >
  // Create a link to MSSQL
  $link = mssql_connect('KALLESPC\SQLEXPRESS', 'sa', 'phpfi');
  
  // Select the database 'php'
  mssql_select_db('php', $link);
?>
