list -- Assign variables as if they were an array

  void list(mixed varname [, mixed ...])~

Like |array|, this is not really a function, but a language construct. |list|
is used to assign a list of variables in one operation.

{varname} A variable.

No value is returned.

|list| examples

<?php >
  $info = array('coffee', 'brown', 'caffeine');
  
  // Listing all the variables
  list($drink, $color, $power) = $info;
  echo "$drink is $color and $power makes it special.\n";
  
  // Listing some of them
  list($drink, , $power) = $info;
  echo "$drink has $power.\n";
  
  // Or let's skip to only the third one
  list( , , $power) = $info;
  echo "I need $power!\n";
  
  // list() doesn't work with strings
  list($bar) = "abcde";
  var_dump($bar); // NULL
?>





An example use of |list|

  <table>
   <tr>
    <th>Employee name</th>
    <th>Salary</th>
   </tr>
<?php >
  $result = mysql_query("SELECT id, name, salary FROM employees", $conn);
  while (list($id, $name, $salary) = mysql_fetch_row($result)) {
      echo " <tr>\n" .
            "  <td><a href=\"info.php?id=$id\">$name</a></td>\n" .
            "  <td>$salary</td>\n" .
            " </tr>\n";
  }
?>
  
  </table>





Using nested |list|

<?php >
  list($a, list($b, $c)) = array(1, array(2, 3));
  
  var_dump($a, $b, $c);
?>

  int(1)
  int(2)
  int(3)



Using |list| with array indices

<?php >
  $info = array('coffee', 'brown', 'caffeine');
  
  list($a[0], $a[1], $a[2]) = $info;
  
  var_dump($a);
?>

Gives the following output (note the order of the elements compared in which
order they were written in the |list| syntax):

  array(3) {
    [2]=>
    string(8) "caffeine"
    [1]=>
    string(5) "brown"
    [0]=>
    string(6) "coffee"
  }



|list| assigns the values starting with the right-most parameter. If you are
using plain variables, you don't have to worry about this. But if you are
using arrays with indices you usually expect the order of the indices in the
array the same you wrote in the |list| from left to right; which it isn't.
It's assigned in the reverse order.

|list| only works on numerical arrays and assumes the numerical indices start
at 0.

|each| |array| |extract|
