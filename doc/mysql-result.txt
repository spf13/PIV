mysql_result -- Get result data

  string mysql_result(resource result, int row [, mixed field])~

Retrieves the contents of one cell from a MySQL result set.

When working on large result sets, you should consider using one of the
functions that fetch an entire row (specified below). As these functions
return the contents of multiple cells in one function call, they're MUCH
quicker than |mysql_result|. Also, note that specifying a numeric offset for
the field argument is much quicker than specifying a fieldname or
tablename.fieldname argument.

{ result}The result resource that is being evaluated. This result comes from a
call to |mysql_query|.

{row} The row number from the result that's being retrieved. Row numbers start
at 0.

{field} The name or offset of the field being retrieved.

It can be the field's offset, the field's name, or the field's table dot field
name (tablename.fieldname). If the column name has been aliased ('select foo
as bar from...'), use the alias instead of the column name. If undefined, the
first field is retrieved.

The contents of one cell from a MySQL result set on success, or FALSE on
failure.

|mysql_result| example

<?php >
  $link = mysql_connect('localhost', 'mysql_user', 'mysql_password');
  if (!$link) {
      die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error());
  }
  $result = mysql_query('SELECT name FROM work.employee');
  if (!$result) {
      die('Could not query:' . mysql_error());
  }
  echo mysql_result($result, 2); // outputs third employee's name
  
  mysql_close($link);
?>





Calls to |mysql_result| should not be mixed with calls to other functions that
deal with the result set.

|mysql_fetch_row| |mysql_fetch_array| |mysql_fetch_assoc| |mysql_fetch_object|
