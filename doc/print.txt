print -- Output a string

  int print(string arg)~

Outputs {arg}.

|print| is not actually a real function (it is a language construct) so you
are not required to use parentheses with its argument list.

For a short discussion about the differences between |print| and |echo|, see
this FAQTs Knowledge Base Article:
http://www.faqts.com/knowledge_base/view.phtml/aid/1/fid/40

{arg} The input data.

Returns 1, always.

|print| examples

<?php >
  print("Hello World");
  
  print "print() also works without parentheses.";
  
  print "This spans
  multiple lines. The newlines will be
  output as well";
  
  print "This spans\nmultiple lines. The newlines will be\noutput as well.";
  
  print "escaping characters is done \"Like this\".";
  
  // You can use variables inside of a print statement
  $foo = "foobar";
  $bar = "barbaz";
  
  print "foo is $foo"; // foo is foobar
  
  // You can also use arrays
  $bar = array("value" => "foo");
  
  print "this is {$bar['value']} !"; // this is foo !
  
  // Using single quotes will print the variable name, not the value
  print 'foo is $foo'; // foo is $foo
  
  // If you are not using any other characters, you can just print variables
  print $foo;          // foobar
  
  print <<<END
  This uses the "here document" syntax to output
  multiple lines with $variable interpolation. Note
  that the here document terminator must appear on a
  line with just a semicolon no extra whitespace!
  END;
?>





Because this is a language construct and not a function, it cannot be called
using variable functions
