posix_getpwnam -- Return info about a user by username

  array posix_getpwnam(string username)~

Returns an array of information about the given user.

{username} An alphanumeric username.

On success an array with the following elements are returned, else FALSE is
returned: The user information array Element Description name The name element
contains the username of the user. This is a short, usually less than 16
character "handle" of the user, not the real, full name. This should be the
same as the {username} parameter used when calling the function, and hence
redundant. passwd The passwd element contains the user's password in an
encrypted format. Often, for example on a system employing "shadow" passwords,
an asterisk is returned instead. uid User ID of the user in numeric form. gid
The group ID of the user. Use the function |posix_getgrgid| to resolve the
group name and a list of its members. gecos GECOS is an obsolete term that
refers to the finger information field on a Honeywell batch processing system.
The field, however, lives on, and its contents have been formalized by POSIX.
The field contains a comma separated list containing the user's full name,
office phone, office number, and home phone number. On most systems, only the
user's full name is available. dir This element contains the absolute path to
the home directory of the user. shell The shell element contains the absolute
path to the executable of the user's default shell.

Example use of |posix_getpwnam|

<?php >
  $userinfo = posix_getpwnam("tom");
  
  print_r($userinfo);
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  Array
  (
      [name]    => tom
      [passwd]  => x
      [uid]     => 10000
      [gid]     => 42
      [geocs]   => "tom,,,"
      [dir]     => "/home/tom"
      [shell]   => "/bin/bash"
  )
