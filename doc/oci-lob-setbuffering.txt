OCI-Lob->setBuffering -- Changes current state of buffering for the large
object

  bool setBuffering(bool on_off)~

Sets the buffering for the large object, depending on the value of the
{on_off} parameter.

Use of this function may provide performance improvements by buffering small
reads and writes of LOBs by reducing the number of network round-trips and LOB
versions. |oci_lob_flush| should be used to flush buffers, when you have
finished working with the large object.

{on_off} TRUE for on and FALSE for off.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure. Repeated calls to this method
with the same flag will return TRUE.
