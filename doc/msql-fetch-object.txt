msql_fetch_object -- Fetch row as object

  object msql_fetch_object(resource result)~

|msql_fetch_object| is similar to |msql_fetch_array|, with one difference - an
object is returned, instead of an array. Indirectly, that means that you can
only access the data by the field names, and not by their offsets (numbers are
illegal property names).

Speed-wise, the function is identical to |msql_fetch_array|, and almost as
quick as |msql_fetch_row| (the difference is insignificant).

{ result}The result resource that is being evaluated. This result comes from a
call to |msql_query|.

Returns an object with properties that correspond to the fetched row, or FALSE
if there are no more rows.

|msql_fetch_object| example

<?php >
  $con = msql_connect();
  if (!$con) {
      die('Server connection problem: ' . msql_error());
  }
  
  if (!msql_select_db('test', $con)) {
      die('Database connection problem: ' . msql_error());
  }
  
  $result = msql_query('SELECT id, name FROM people', $con);
  if (!$result) {
      die('Query execution problem: ' . msql_error());
  }
  
  while ($row = msql_fetch_object($result, MSQL_ASSOC)) {
      echo $row->id . ': ' . $row->name . "\n";
  }
  
  msql_free_result($result);
?>





Version Description 4.3.11 and 5.0.4 A bug was fixed when retrieving data from
columns containing NULL values. Such columns were not placed into the
resulting array.
