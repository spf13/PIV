preg_match -- Perform a regular expression match

  int preg_match(string pattern, string subject [, array matches [, int flags [, int offset]]])~

Searches {subject} for a match to the regular expression given in {pattern}.

{pattern} The pattern to search for, as a string.

{subject} The input string.

{matches} If {matches} is provided, then it is filled with the results of
search. $matches[0] will contain the text that matched the full pattern,
$matches[1] will have the text that matched the first captured parenthesized
subpattern, and so on.

{flags} {flags} can be the following flag: PREG_OFFSET_CAPTURE If this flag is
passed, for every occurring match the appendant string offset will also be
returned. Note that this changes the return value in an array where every
element is an array consisting of the matched string at index 0 and its string
offset into {subject} at index 1.

{offset} Normally, the search starts from the beginning of the subject string.
The optional parameter {offset} can be used to specify the alternate place
from which to start the search (in bytes).
