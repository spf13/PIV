  bool w32api_deftype(string typename, string member1_type, string member1_name [, string ... [, string ...]])~

You need to call this function if you would like to define a type for a w32api
call.

{typename} The name of the type.

{member1_type} A member type can be a user defined type. All the type names
are case sensitive. Built in type names should be provided in lowercase.

{member1_name} The member name of {member1_type}.

This function takes 2n+1 arguments, where n is the number of members the type
has. After that is the type of the member followed by the members name (in
pairs).

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.
