pcntl_waitpid -- Waits on or returns the status of a forked child

  int pcntl_waitpid(int pid, int status [, int options])~

Suspends execution of the current process until a child as specified by the
{pid} argument has exited, or until a signal is delivered whose action is to
terminate the current process or to call a signal handling function.

If a child as requested by {pid} has already exited by the time of the call (a
so-called "zombie" process), the function returns immediately. Any system
resources used by the child are freed. Please see your system's waitpid(2) man
page for specific details as to how waitpid works on your system.
