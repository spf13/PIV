fbsql_connect -- Open a connection to a FrontBase Server

  resource fbsql_connect([string hostname [, string username [, string password]]])~

|fbsql_connect| establishes a connection to a FrontBase server.

If a second call is made to |fbsql_connect| with the same arguments, no new
link will be established, but instead, the link identifier of the already
opened link will be returned.

The link to the server will be closed as soon as the execution of the script
ends, unless it's closed earlier by explicitly calling |fbsql_close|.

{hostname} The server host name. Defaults to 'NULL'.

{username} The user name for the connection. Defaults to _SYSTEM.

{password} The password for the connection. Defaults to the empty string.

Returns a positive FrontBase link identifier on success, or FALSE on errors.

|fbsql_connect| example

<?php >
  $link = fbsql_connect("localhost", "_SYSTEM", "secret")
      or die("Could not connect");
  echo "Connected successfully";
  fbsql_close($link);
?>
