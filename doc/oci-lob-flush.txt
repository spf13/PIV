OCI-Lob->flush -- Flushes/writes buffer of the LOB to the server

  bool flush([int flag])~

|OCI-Lob->flush| actually writes data to the server.

{flag} By default, resources are not freed, but using flag OCI_LOB_BUFFER_FREE
you can do it explicitly. Be sure you know what you're doing - next read/write
operation to the same part of LOB will involve a round-trip to the server and
initialize new buffer resources. It is recommended to use OCI_LOB_BUFFER_FREE
flag only when you are not going to work with the LOB anymore.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

Returns FALSE if buffering was not enabled or an error occurred.
