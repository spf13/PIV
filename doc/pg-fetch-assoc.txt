pg_fetch_assoc -- Fetch a row as an associative array

  array pg_fetch_assoc(resource result [, int row])~

|pg_fetch_assoc| returns an associative array that corresponds to the fetched
row (records).

|pg_fetch_assoc| is equivalent to calling |pg_fetch_array| with PGSQL_ASSOC as
the optional third parameter. It only returns an associative array. If you
need the numeric indices, use |pg_fetch_row|.

This function sets NULL fields to the PHP NULL value.

|pg_fetch_assoc| is NOT significantly slower than using |pg_fetch_row|, and is
significantly easier to use.

{result} PostgreSQL query result resource, returned by |pg_query|,
|pg_query_params| or |pg_execute| (among others).

{row} Row number in result to fetch. Rows are numbered from 0 upwards. If
omitted, next row is fetched.

An array indexed associatively (by field name). Each value in the array is
represented as a string. Database NULL values are returned as NULL.

FALSE is returned if {row} exceeds the number of rows in the set, there are no
more rows, or on any other error.

Version Description 4.1.0 The parameter {row} became optional.
