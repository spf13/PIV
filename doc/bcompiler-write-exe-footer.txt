bcompiler_write_exe_footer -- Writes the start pos, and sig to the end of a
exe type file

  bool bcompiler_write_exe_footer(resource filehandle, int startpos)~

An EXE (or self executable) file consists of 3 parts: The stub (executable
code, e.g. a compiled C program) that loads PHP interpreter, bcompiler
extension, stored Bytecodes and initiates a call for the specified function
(e.g. main) or class method (e.g. main::main) The Bytecodes (uncompressed only
for the moment) The bcompiler EXE footer

To obtain a suitable stub you can compile php_embed-based stub phpe.c located
in the examples/embed directory on bcompiler's CVS.

{filehandle} A file handle as returned by |fopen|.

{startpos} The file position at which the Bytecodes start, and can be obtained
using |ftell|.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
