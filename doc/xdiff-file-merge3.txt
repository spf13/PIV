xdiff_file_merge3 -- Merge 3 files into one

  mixed xdiff_file_merge3(string old_file, string new_file1, string new_file2, string dest)~

Merges three files into one and stores the result in a file {dest}. The
{old_file} is an original version while {new_file1} and {new_file2} are
modified versions of an original.

{old_file} Path to the first file. It acts as "old" file.

{new_file1} Path to the second file. It acts as modified version of
{old_file}.

{new_file2} Path to the third file. It acts as modified version of {old_file}.

{dest} Path of the resulting file, containing merged changed from both
{new_file1} and {new_file2}.

Returns TRUE if merge was successful, string with rejected chunks if it was
not or FALSE if an internal error happened.
