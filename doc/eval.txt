eval -- Evaluate a string as PHP code

  mixed eval(string code_str)~

Evaluates the string given in {code_str} as PHP code. Among other things, this
can be useful for storing code in a database text field for later execution.

There are some factors to keep in mind when using |eval|. Remember that the
string passed must be valid PHP code, including things like terminating
statements with a semicolon so the parser doesn't die on the line after the
|eval|, and properly escaping things in {code_str}. To mix HTML output and PHP
code you can use a closing PHP tag to leave PHP mode.

Also remember that variables given values under |eval| will retain these
values in the main script afterwards.

{code_str} The code string to be evaluated. {code_str} does not have to
contain PHP Opening tags.

A return statement will immediately terminate the evaluation of the string .

|eval| returns NULL unless return is called in the evaluated code, in which
case the value passed to return is returned. If there is a parse error in the
evaluated code, |eval| returns FALSE and execution of the following code
continues normally. It is not possible to catch a parse error in |eval| using
|set_error_handler|.

|eval| example - simple text merge

<?php >
  $string = 'cup';
  $name = 'coffee';
  $str = 'This is a $string with my $name in it.';
  echo $str. "\n";
  eval("\$str = \"$str\";");
  echo $str. "\n";
?>

The above example will output:

  This is a $string with my $name in it.
  This is a cup with my coffee in it.



Because this is a language construct and not a function, it cannot be called
using variable functions

As with anything that outputs its result directly to the browser, the
output-control functions can be used to capture the output of this function,
and save it in a string (for example).

In case of a fatal error in the evaluated code, the whole script exits.
