db2_conn_errormsg -- Returns the last connection error message and SQLCODE
value

  string db2_conn_errormsg([resource connection])~

|db2_conn_errormsg| returns an error message and SQLCODE value representing
the reason the last database connection attempt failed. As |db2_connect|
returns FALSE in the event of a failed connection attempt, do not pass any
parameters to |db2_conn_errormsg| to retrieve the associated error message and
SQLCODE value.

If, however, the connection was successful but becomes invalid over time, you
can pass the {connection} parameter to retrieve the associated error message
and SQLCODE value for a specific connection.

{connection} A connection resource associated with a connection that initially
succeeded, but which over time became invalid.

Returns a string containing the error message and SQLCODE value resulting from
a failed connection attempt. If there is no error associated with the last
connection attempt, |db2_conn_errormsg| returns an empty string.

Retrieving the error message returned by a failed connection attempt The
following example demonstrates how to return an error message and SQLCODE
value after deliberately passing invalid parameters to |db2_connect|.

<?php >
  $conn = db2_connect('badname', 'baduser', 'badpassword');
  if (!$conn) {
      print db2_conn_errormsg();
  }
?>

The above example will output:

  [IBM][CLI Driver] SQL1013N  The database alias name
  or database name "BADNAME" could not be found.  SQLSTATE=42705
   SQLCODE=-1013
