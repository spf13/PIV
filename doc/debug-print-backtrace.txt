|debug_print_backtrace| example

<?php >
  // include.php file
  
  function a() {
      b();
  }
  
  function b() {
      c();
  }
  
  function c(){
      debug_print_backtrace();
  }
  
  a();
?>

<?php >
  // test.php file
  // this is the file you should run
  
  include 'include.php';
?>

  #0  eval() called at [/tmp/include.php:5]
  #1  a() called at [/tmp/include.php:17]
  #2  include(/tmp/include.php) called at [/tmp/test.php:3]
  
  #0  c() called at [/tmp/include.php:10]
  #1  b() called at [/tmp/include.php:6]
  #2  a() called at [/tmp/include.php:17]
