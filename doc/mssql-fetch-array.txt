mssql_fetch_array -- Fetch a result row as an associative array, a numeric
array, or both

  array mssql_fetch_array(resource result [, int result_type])~

|mssql_fetch_array| is an extended version of |mssql_fetch_row|. In addition
to storing the data in the numeric indices of the result array, it also stores
the data in associative indices, using the field names as keys.

An important thing to note is that using |mssql_fetch_array| is NOT
significantly slower than using |mssql_fetch_row|, while it provides a
significant added value.

{result} The result resource that is being evaluated. This result comes from a
call to |mssql_query|.

{result_type} The type of array that is to be fetched. It's a constant and can
take the following values: MSSQL_ASSOC, MSSQL_NUM, and the default value of
MSSQL_BOTH.

Returns an array that corresponds to the fetched row, or FALSE if there are no
more rows.

|mssql_fetch_array| example

<?php >
  // Send a select query to MSSQL
  $query = mssql_query('SELECT [username], [name] FROM [php].[dbo].[userlist]');
  
  // Check if there were any records
  if(!mssql_num_rows($query))
  {
  	echo 'No records found';
  }
  else
  {
  	// The following is equal to the code below:
  	//
  	// while($row = mssql_fetch_row($query))
  
  	while($row = mssql_fetch_array($query, MSSQL_NUM))
  	{
  		// ...
  	}
  }
  
  // Free the query result
  mssql_free_result($query);
?>
