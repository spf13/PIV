This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

This function does not perform dependency checking, so make sure you write the
classes in an order that will not result in an undefined class error occurring
when you load it.
