msql_close -- Close mSQL connection

  bool msql_close([resource link_identifier])~

|msql_close| closes the non-persistent connection to the mSQL server that's
associated with the specified link identifier.

Using |msql_close| isn't usually necessary, as non-persistent open links are
automatically closed at the end of the script's execution. See also freeing
resources.

{ link_identifier}The mSQL connection. If not specified, the last link opened
by |msql_connect| is assumed. If no such link is found, the function will try
to establish a link as if |msql_connect| was called, and use it.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
