stat -- Gives information about a file

  array stat(string filename)~

Gathers the statistics of the file named by {filename}. If {filename} is a
symbolic link, statistics are from the file itself, not the symlink.

|lstat| is identical to |stat| except it would instead be based off the
symlinks status.

{filename} Path to the file.

|stat| and |fstat| result format Numeric Associative (since PHP 4.0.6)
Description 0 dev device number 1 ino inode number * 2 mode inode protection
mode 3 nlink number of links 4 uid userid of owner * 5 gid groupid of owner *
6 rdev device type, if inode device 7 size size in bytes 8 atime time of last
access (Unix timestamp) 9 mtime time of last modification (Unix timestamp) 10
ctime time of last inode change (Unix timestamp) 11 blksize blocksize of
filesystem IO ** 12 blocks number of blocks allocated ** * On Windows this
will always be 0.

** Only valid on systems supporting the st_blksize type - other systems (e.g.
Windows) return -1.

In case of error, |stat| returns FALSE.

Upon failure, an E_WARNING is emitted.

Version Description 4.0.6 In addition to returning these attributes in a
numeric array, they can be accessed with associative indices, as noted next to
each parameter

|stat| example

<?php >
  /* Get file stat */
  $stat = stat('C:\php\php.exe');
  
  /*
   * Print file access file, this is the same 
   * as calling fileatime()
   */
  echo 'Access time: ' . $stat['atime'];
  
  /*
   * Print file modification time, this is the 
   * same as calling filemtime()
   */
  echo 'Modification time: ' . $stat['mtime'];
  
  /* Print the device number */
  echo 'Device number: ' . $stat['dev'];





Using |stat| information together with |touch|

<?php >
  /* Get file stat */
  $stat = @stat('C:\php\php.exe');
  
  /* Did we failed to get stat information ? */
  if(!$stat)
  {
      echo 'Stat call failed...';
  }
  else
  {
      /*
       * We want the access time to be 1 week 
       * before the current access time.
       */
      $atime = $stat['atime'] + 604800;
  
      /* Touch the file */
      if(!@touch('some_file.txt', time(), $atime))
      {
          echo 'Failed to touch file...';
      }
      else
      {
          echo 'Touch returned success...';
      }
  }
?>





Note that time resolution may differ from one file system to another.

The results of this function are cached. See |clearstatcache| for more
details.

As of PHP 5.0.0, this function can also be used with some URL wrappers. Refer
to for a listing of which wrappers support |stat| family of functionality.
