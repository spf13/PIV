aggregate_properties_by_regexp -- Selective class properties aggregation to an
object using a regular expression

  void aggregate_properties_by_regexp(object object, string class_name, string regexp [, bool exclude])~

Aggregates properties from a class to an existing object using a regular
expression to match their names.

The properties whose names start with an underscore character (_), which are
considered private to the aggregated class, are always excluded.

{object}

{class_name}

{regexp}

{exclude} The optional parameter {exclude} is used to decide whether the
regular expression will select the names of class properties to include in the
aggregation (i.e. {exclude} is FALSE, which is the default value), or to
exclude from the aggregation ({exclude} is TRUE).

No value is returned.
