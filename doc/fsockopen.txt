fsockopen -- Open Internet or Unix domain socket connection

  resource fsockopen(string hostname [, int port [, int errno [, string errstr [, float timeout]]]])~

Initiates a socket connection to the resource specified by {hostname}.

PHP supports targets in the Internet and Unix domains as described in . A list
of supported transports can also be retrieved using |stream_get_transports|.

The socket will by default be opened in blocking mode. You can switch it to
non-blocking mode by using |stream_set_blocking|.

{hostname} If you have compiled in OpenSSL support, you may prefix the
{hostname} with either ssl:// or tls:// to use an SSL or TLS client connection
over TCP/IP to connect to the remote host.

{port} The port number.

{errno} If provided, holds the system level error number that occurred in the
system-level connect() call.

If the value returned in {errno} is 0 and the function returned FALSE, it is
an indication that the error occurred before the connect() call. This is most
likely due to a problem initializing the socket.

{errstr} The error message as a string.

{timeout} The connection timeout, in seconds.

If you need to set a timeout for reading/writing data over the socket, use
|stream_set_timeout|, as the {timeout} parameter to |fsockopen| only applies
while connecting the socket.

|fsockopen| returns a file pointer which may be used together with the other
file functions (such as |fgets|, |fgetss|, |fwrite|, |fclose|, and |feof|). If
the call fails, it will return FALSE

Throws E_WARNING if {hostname} is not a valid domain.

Version Description 4.3.0 Added support for the {timeout} parameter on win32.
4.3.0 SSL and TLS over TCP/IP support was added. 4.0.0 UDP support was added.

|fsockopen| Example

<?php >
  $fp = fsockopen("www.example.com", 80, $errno, $errstr, 30);
  if (!$fp) {
      echo "$errstr ($errno)<br />\n";
  } else {
      $out = "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n";
      $out .= "Host: www.example.com\r\n";
      $out .= "Connection: Close\r\n\r\n";
      fwrite($fp, $out);
      while (!feof($fp)) {
          echo fgets($fp, 128);
      }
      fclose($fp);
  }
?>





Using UDP connection The example below shows how to retrieve the day and time
from the UDP service "daytime" (port 13) in your own machine.

<?php >
  $fp = fsockopen("udp://127.0.0.1", 13, $errno, $errstr);
  if (!$fp) {
      echo "ERROR: $errno - $errstr<br />\n";
  } else {
      fwrite($fp, "\n");
      echo fread($fp, 26);
      fclose($fp);
  }
?>



Depending on the environment, the Unix domain or the optional connect timeout
may not be available.

UDP sockets will sometimes appear to have opened without an error, even if the
remote host is unreachable. The error will only become apparent when you read
or write data to/from the socket. The reason for this is because UDP is a
"connectionless" protocol, which means that the operating system does not try
to establish a link for the socket until it actually needs to send or receive
data.

When specifying a numerical IPv6 address (e.g. fe80::1), you must enclose the
IP in square bracketsâfor example, tcp://[fe80::1]:80.
