ibase_fetch_assoc -- Fetch a result row from a query as an associative array

  array ibase_fetch_assoc(resource result [, int fetch_flag])~

Fetch a result row from a query as an associative array.

|ibase_fetch_assoc| fetches one row of data from the {result}. If two or more
columns of the result have the same field names, the last column will take
precedence. To access the other column(s) of the same name, you either need to
access the result with numeric indices by using |ibase_fetch_row| or use alias
names in your query.

{result} The result handle.

{fetch_flag} {fetch_flag} is a combination of the constants IBASE_TEXT and
IBASE_UNIXTIME ORed together. Passing IBASE_TEXT will cause this function to
return BLOB contents instead of BLOB ids. Passing IBASE_UNIXTIME will cause
this function to return date/time values as Unix timestamps instead of as
formatted strings.

Returns an associative array that corresponds to the fetched row. Subsequent
calls will return the next row in the result set, or FALSE if there are no
more rows.
