mysql_free_result -- Free result memory

  bool mysql_free_result(resource result)~

|mysql_free_result| will free all memory associated with the result identifier
{result}.

|mysql_free_result| only needs to be called if you are concerned about how
much memory is being used for queries that return large result sets. All
associated result memory is automatically freed at the end of the script's
execution.

{ result}The result resource that is being evaluated. This result comes from a
call to |mysql_query|.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

If a non-resource is used for the {result}, an error of level E_WARNING will
be emitted. It's worth noting that |mysql_query| only returns a resource for
SELECT, SHOW, EXPLAIN, and DESCRIBE queries.

A |mysql_free_result| example

<?php >
  $result = mysql_query("SELECT id,email FROM people WHERE id = '42'");
  if (!$result) {
      echo 'Could not run query: ' . mysql_error();
      exit;
  }
  /* Use the result, assuming we're done with it afterwards */
  $row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result);
  
  /* Now we free up the result and continue on with our script */
  mysql_free_result($result);
  
  echo $row['id'];
  echo $row['email'];
?>
