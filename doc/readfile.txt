readfile -- Outputs a file

  int readfile(string filename [, bool use_include_path [, resource context]])~

Reads a file and writes it to the output buffer.

{filename} The filename being read.

{use_include_path} You can use the optional second parameter and set it to
TRUE, if you want to search for the file in the include_path, too.

{context} A context stream resource.

Returns the number of bytes read from the file. If an error occurs, FALSE is
returned and unless the function was called as @|readfile|, an error message
is printed.

Forcing a download using |readfile|

<?php >
  $file = 'monkey.gif';
  
  if (file_exists($file)) {
      header('Content-Description: File Transfer');
      header('Content-Type: application/octet-stream');
      header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename='.basename($file));
      header('Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary');
      header('Expires: 0');
      header('Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0');
      header('Pragma: public');
      header('Content-Length: ' . filesize($file));
      ob_clean();
      flush();
      readfile($file);
      exit;
  }
?>

The above example will output something similar to:



A URL can be used as a filename with this function if the fopen wrappers have
been enabled. See |fopen| for more details on how to specify the filename and
for a list of supported URL protocols.

Context support was added with PHP 5.0.0. For a description of contexts, refer
