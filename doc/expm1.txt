This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

|expm1| returns the equivalent to 'exp({arg}) - 1' computed in a way that is
accurate even if the value of {arg} is near zero, a case where 'exp ({arg}) -
1' would be inaccurate due to subtraction of two numbers that are nearly
equal.

{arg} The argument to process

'e' to the power of {arg} minus one

Version Description 5.3.0 This function is now available on all platforms
