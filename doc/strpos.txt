strpos -- Find position of first occurrence of a string

  int strpos(string haystack, mixed needle [, int offset])~

Returns the numeric position of the first occurrence of {needle} in the
{haystack} string. Unlike the |strrpos| before PHP 5, this function can take a
full string as the {needle} parameter and the entire string will be used.

{haystack} The string to search in

{needle} If {needle} is not a string, it is converted to an integer and
applied as the ordinal value of a character.

{offset} The optional {offset} parameter allows you to specify which character
in {haystack} to start searching. The position returned is still relative to
the beginning of {haystack}.

Returns the position as an integer. If {needle} is not found, |strpos| will
return boolean FALSE.

This function may return Boolean FALSE, but may also return a non-Boolean
value which evaluates to FALSE, such as 0 or "". Please read the section on
Booleans for more information. Use the === operator for testing the return
value of this function.

Using ===

<?php >
  $mystring = 'abc';
  $findme   = 'a';
  $pos = strpos($mystring, $findme);
  
  // Note our use of ===.  Simply == would not work as expected
  // because the position of 'a' was the 0th (first) character.
  if ($pos === false) {
      echo "The string '$findme' was not found in the string '$mystring'";
  } else {
      echo "The string '$findme' was found in the string '$mystring'";
      echo " and exists at position $pos";
  }
?>



Using !==

<?php >
  $mystring = 'abc';
  $findme   = 'a';
  $pos = strpos($mystring, $findme);
  
  // The !== operator can also be used.  Using != would not work as expected
  // because the position of 'a' is 0. The statement (0 != false) evaluates 
  // to false.
  if ($pos !== false) {
       echo "The string '$findme' was found in the string '$mystring'";
           echo " and exists at position $pos";
  } else {
       echo "The string '$findme' was not found in the string '$mystring'";
  }
?>



Using an offset

<?php >
  // We can search for the character, ignoring anything before the offset
  $newstring = 'abcdef abcdef';
  $pos = strpos($newstring, 'a', 1); // $pos = 7, not 0
?>





This function is binary-safe.
