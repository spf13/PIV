fgetcsv -- Gets line from file pointer and parse for CSV fields

  array fgetcsv(resource handle [, int length [, string delimiter [, string enclosure [, string escape]]]])~

Similar to |fgets| except that |fgetcsv| parses the line it reads for fields
in CSV format and returns an array containing the fields read.

{handle} A valid file pointer to a file successfully opened by |fopen|,
|popen|, or |fsockopen|.

{length} Must be greater than the longest line (in characters) to be found in
the CSV file (allowing for trailing line-end characters). It became optional
in PHP 5. Omitting this parameter (or setting it to 0 in PHP 5.0.4 and later)
the maximum line length is not limited, which is slightly slower.

{delimiter} Set the field delimiter (one character only). Defaults as a comma.

{enclosure} Set the field enclosure character (one character only). Defaults
as a double quotation mark.

{escape} Set the escape character (one character only). Defaults as a
backslash (\)

Returns an indexed array containing the fields read.

A blank line in a CSV file will be returned as an array comprising a single
null field, and will not be treated as an error.

If PHP is not properly recognizing the line endings when reading files either
on or created by a Macintosh computer, enabling the auto_detect_line_endings
run-time configuration option may help resolve the problem.

|fgetcsv| returns FALSE on error, including end of file.

Version Description 5.3.0 The {escape} parameter was added 4.3.5 |fgetcsv| is
now binary safe 4.3.0 The {enclosure} parameter was added

Read and print the entire contents of a CSV file

<?php >
  $row = 1;
  $handle = fopen("test.csv", "r");
  while (($data = fgetcsv($handle, 1000, ",")) !== FALSE) {
      $num = count($data);
      echo "<p> $num fields in line $row: <br /></p>\n";
      $row++;
      for ($c=0; $c < $num; $c++) {
          echo $data[$c] . "<br />\n";
      }
  }
  fclose($handle);
?>





Locale setting is taken into account by this function. If LANG is e.g.
en_US.UTF-8, files in one-byte encoding are read wrong by this function.
