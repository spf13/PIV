stream_set_blocking -- Set blocking/non-blocking mode on a stream

  bool stream_set_blocking(resource stream, int mode)~

Sets blocking or non-blocking mode on a {stream}.

This function works for any stream that supports non-blocking mode (currently,
regular files and socket streams).

{stream} The stream.

{mode} If {mode} is 0, the given stream will be switched to non-blocking mode,
and if 1, it will be switched to blocking mode. This affects calls like
|fgets| and |fread| that read from the stream. In non-blocking mode an |fgets|
call will always return right away while in blocking mode it will wait for
data to become available on the stream.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

Version Description 4.3.0 Prior to PHP 4.3.0, this function only worked on
socket based streams.

This function was previously called as |set_socket_blocking| and later
|socket_set_blocking| but this usage is deprecated.
