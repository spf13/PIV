socket_recvfrom -- Receives data from a socket whether or not it is
connection-oriented

  int socket_recvfrom(resource socket, string buf, int len, int flags, string name [, int port])~

The |socket_recvfrom| function receives {len} bytes of data in {buf} from
{name} on port {port} (if the socket is not of type AF_UNIX) using {socket}.
|socket_recvfrom| can be used to gather data from both connected and
unconnected sockets. Additionally, one or more flags can be specified to
modify the behaviour of the function.

The {name} and {port} must be passed by reference. If the socket is not
connection-oriented, {name} will be set to the internet protocol address of
the remote host or the path to the UNIX socket. If the socket is
connection-oriented, {name} is NULL. Additionally, the {port} will contain the
port of the remote host in the case of an unconnected AF_INET or AF_INET6
socket.

{socket} The {socket} must be a socket resource previously created by
socket_create().

{buf} The data received will be fetched to the variable specified with {buf}.

{len} Up to {len} bytes will be fetched from remote host.

{flags} The value of {flags} can be any combination of the following flags,
joined with the binary OR (|) operator.

Possible values for {flags} Flag Description MSG_OOB Process out-of-band data.
MSG_PEEK Receive data from the beginning of the receive queue without removing
it from the queue. MSG_WAITALL Block until at least {len} are received.
However, if a signal is caught or the remote host disconnects, the function
may return less data. MSG_DONTWAIT With this flag set, the function returns
even if it would normally have blocked. {name} If the socket is of the type
AF_UNIX type, {name} is the path to the file. Else, for unconnected sockets,
{name} is the IP address of, the remote host, or NULL if the socket is
connection-oriented.

{port} This argument only applies to AF_INET and AF_INET6 sockets, and
specifies the remote port from which the data is received. If the socket is
connection-oriented, {port} will be NULL.

|socket_recvfrom| returns the number of bytes received, or -1 if there was an
error. The actual error code can be retrieved by calling |socket_last_error|.
This error code may be passed to |socket_strerror| to get a textual
explanation of the error.

|socket_recvfrom| example

<?php >
  error_reporting(E_ALL | E_STRICT);
  
  $socket = socket_create(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, SOL_UDP);
  socket_bind($socket, '127.0.0.1', 1223);
  
  $from = "";
  $port = 0;
  socket_recvfrom($socket, $buf, 12, 0, $from, $port);
  
  echo "Received $buf from remote address $from and remote port $port" . PHP_EOL;
?>

This example will initiate an UDP socket on port 1223 of 127.0.0.1 and print
at most 12 characters received from a remote host.





Version Description 4.3.0 |socket_recvfrom| is now binary safe.
