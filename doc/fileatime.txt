fileatime -- Gets last access time of file

  int fileatime(string filename)~

Gets the last access time of the given file.

{filename} Path to the file.

Returns the time the file was last accessed, or FALSE in case of an error. The
time is returned as a Unix timestamp.

|fileatime| example

<?php >
  // outputs e.g.  somefile.txt was last accessed: December 29 2002 22:16:23.
  
  $filename = 'somefile.txt';
  if (file_exists($filename)) {
      echo "$filename was last accessed: " . date("F d Y H:i:s.", fileatime($filename));
  }
?>





The atime of a file is supposed to change whenever the data blocks of a file
are being read. This can be costly performance-wise when an application
regularly accesses a very large number of files or directories.

Some Unix filesystems can be mounted with atime updates disabled to increase
the performance of such applications; USENET news spools are a common example.
On such filesystems this function will be useless.

Note that time resolution may differ from one file system to another.

The results of this function are cached. See |clearstatcache| for more
details.

As of PHP 5.0.0, this function can also be used with some URL wrappers. Refer
to for a listing of which wrappers support |stat| family of functionality.
