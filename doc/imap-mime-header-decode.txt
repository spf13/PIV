imap_mime_header_decode -- Decode MIME header elements

  array imap_mime_header_decode(string text)~

|imap_mime_header_decode| function decodes MIME message header extensions that
are non ASCII text (see RFC2047) The decoded elements are returned in an array
of objects, where each object has two properties, "charset" and "text". If the
element hasn't been encoded, and in other words is in plain US-ASCII,the
"charset" property of that element is set to "default".

|imap_mime_header_decode| example

<?php >
  $text = "=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Keld_J=F8rn_Simonsen?= <keld@example.com>";
  
  $elements = imap_mime_header_decode($text);
  for ($i=0; $i<count($elements); $i++) {
      echo "Charset: {$elements[$i]->charset}\n";
      echo "Text: {$elements[$i]->text}\n\n";
  }
?>

In the above example we would have two elements, whereas the first element had
previously been encoded with ISO-8859-1, and the second element would be plain
US-ASCII.
