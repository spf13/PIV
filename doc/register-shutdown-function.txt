register_shutdown_function -- Register a function for execution on shutdown

  void register_shutdown_function(callback function [, mixed parameter [, mixed ...]])~

Registers the function named by {function} to be executed when script
processing is complete.

Multiple calls to |register_shutdown_function| can be made, and each will be
called in the same order as they were registered. If you call |exit| within
one registered shutdown function, processing will stop completely and no other
registered shutdown functions will be called.

{function} The shutdown function to register.

The shutdown functions are called as the part of the request so that it's
possible to send the output from them. There is currently no way to process
the data with output buffering functions in the shutdown function.

Shutdown functions are called after closing all opened output buffers thus,
for example, its output will not be compressed if zlib.output_compression is
enabled.

{parameter} It is possible to pass parameters to the shutdown function by
passing additional parameters.

{...}

No value is returned.

Version Description 4.1.0 The shutdown functions are now called as a part of
the request. In earlier versions under Apache, the registered shutdown
functions were called after the request has been completed (including sending
any output buffers), so it was not possible to send output to the browser
using |echo| or |print|, or retrieve the contents of any output buffers using
|ob_get_contents|. Headers were also always already sent. 4.0.0 Added the
possibility to pass parameters to the shutdown function.

|register_shutdown_function| example

<?php >
  function shutdown()
  {
  	// This is our shutdown function, in 
  	// here we can do any last operations
  	// before the script is complete.
  
  	echo 'Script executed with success', PHP_EOL;
  }
  
  register_shutdown_function('shutdown');
?>





Typically undefined functions cause fatal errors in PHP, but when the
{function} called with |register_shutdown_function| is undefined, an error of
level E_WARNING is generated instead. Also, for reasons internal to PHP, this
error will refer to Unknown at line #0.

Working directory of the script can change inside the shutdown function under
some web servers, e.g. Apache.
