<?php >
  $strings = array('ABasdk!@!$#', '!@ # $', '*&amp;$()');
  foreach ($strings as $testcase) {
      if (ctype_punct($testcase)) {
          echo "The string $testcase consists of all punctuation.\n";
      } else {
          echo "The string $testcase does not consist of all punctuation.\n";
