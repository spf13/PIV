pg_put_line -- Send a NULL-terminated string to PostgreSQL backend

  bool pg_put_line([resource connection, string data])~

|pg_put_line| sends a NULL-terminated string to the PostgreSQL backend server.
This is needed in conjunction with PostgreSQL's COPY FROM command.

COPY is a high-speed data loading interface supported by PostgreSQL. Data is
passed in without being parsed, and in a single transaction.

An alternative to using raw |pg_put_line| commands is to use |pg_copy_from|.
This is a far simpler interface.

The application must explicitly send the two characters "\." on the last line
to indicate to the backend that it has finished sending its data, before
issuing |pg_end_copy|.

Use of the |pg_put_line| causes most large object operations, including
|pg_lo_read| and |pg_lo_tell|, to subsequently fail. You can use
|pg_copy_from| and |pg_copy_to| instead.

{connection} PostgreSQL database connection resource. When {connection} is not
present, the default connection is used. The default connection is the last
connection made by |pg_connect| or |pg_pconnect|.

{data} A line of text to be sent directly to the PostgreSQL backend. A NULL
terminator is added automatically.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

|pg_put_line| example

<?php >
    $conn = pg_pconnect("dbname=foo");
    pg_query($conn, "create table bar (a int4, b char(16), d float8)");
    pg_query($conn, "copy bar from stdin");
    pg_put_line($conn, "3\thello world\t4.5\n");
    pg_put_line($conn, "4\tgoodbye world\t7.11\n");
    pg_put_line($conn, "\\.\n");
    pg_end_copy($conn);
?>
