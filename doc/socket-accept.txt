socket_accept -- Accepts a connection on a socket

  resource socket_accept(resource socket)~

After the socket {socket} has been created using |socket_create|, bound to a
name with |socket_bind|, and told to listen for connections with
|socket_listen|, this function will accept incoming connections on that
socket. Once a successful connection is made, a new socket resource is
returned, which may be used for communication. If there are multiple
connections queued on the socket, the first will be used. If there are no
pending connections, |socket_accept| will block until a connection becomes
present. If {socket} has been made non-blocking using |socket_set_blocking| or
|socket_set_nonblock|, FALSE will be returned.

The socket resource returned by |socket_accept| may not be used to accept new
connections. The original listening socket {socket}, however, remains open and
may be reused.

{socket} A valid socket resource created with |socket_create|.

Returns a new socket resource on success, or FALSE on error. The actual error
code can be retrieved by calling |socket_last_error|. This error code may be
passed to |socket_strerror| to get a textual explanation of the error.
