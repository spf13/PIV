are different from 0.0, 0 or the empty string. Fields of type PX_FIELD_TIME
will be returned as an integer counting the number of milliseconds starting at
midnight. A timestamp (PX_FIELD_TIMESTAMP) and date (PX_FIELD_DATE) are
floating point respectively int values counting milliseconds respectively days
starting at the beginning of julian calendar. Use the functions
|px-timestamp2string| and |px-date2string| to convert them into a character
representation.
