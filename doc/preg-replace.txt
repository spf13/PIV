preg_replace -- Perform a regular expression search and replace

  mixed preg_replace(mixed pattern, mixed replacement, mixed subject [, int limit [, int count]])~

Searches {subject} for matches to {pattern} and replaces them with
{replacement}.

{pattern} The pattern to search for. It can be either a string or an array
with strings.

The e modifier makes |preg_replace| treat the {replacement} parameter as PHP
code after the appropriate references substitution is done. Tip: make sure
that {replacement} constitutes a valid PHP code string, otherwise PHP will
complain about a parse error at the line containing |preg_replace|.

{replacement} The string or an array with strings to replace. If this
parameter is a string and the {pattern} parameter is an array, all patterns
will be replaced by that string. If both {pattern} and {replacement}
parameters are arrays, each {pattern} will be replaced by the {replacement}
counterpart. If there are fewer elements in the {replacement} array than in
the {pattern} array, any extra {pattern}s will be replaced by an empty string.

{replacement} may contain references of the form \\n or (since PHP 4.0.4) $n,
with the latter form being the preferred one. Every such reference will be
replaced by the text captured by the n'th parenthesized pattern. n can be from
0 to 99, and \\0 or $0 refers to the text matched by the whole pattern.
Opening parentheses are counted from left to right (starting from 1) to obtain
the number of the capturing subpattern. To use backslash in replacement, it
must be doubled ("\\\\" PHP string).

When working with a replacement pattern where a backreference is immediately
followed by another number (i.e.: placing a literal number immediately after a
matched pattern), you cannot use the familiar \\1 notation for your
backreference. \\11, for example, would confuse |preg_replace| since it does
not know whether you want the \\1 backreference followed by a literal 1, or
the \\11 backreference followed by nothing. In this case the solution is to
use \${1}1. This creates an isolated $1 backreference, leaving the 1 as a
literal.

When using the e modifier, this function escapes some characters (namely ', ",
\ and NULL) in the strings that replace the backreferences. This is done to
ensure that no syntax errors arise from backreference usage with either single
or double quotes (e.g. 'strlen(\'$1\')+strlen("$2")'). Make sure you are aware
of PHP's string syntax to know exactly how the interpreted string will look
like.

{subject} The string or an array with strings to search and replace.

If {subject} is an array, then the search and replace is performed on every
entry of {subject}, and the return value is an array as well.

{limit} The maximum possible replacements for each pattern in each {subject}
string. Defaults to -1 (no limit).

{count} If specified, this variable will be filled with the number of
replacements done.

|preg_replace| returns an array if the {subject} parameter is an array, or a
string otherwise.

If matches are found, the new {subject} will be returned, otherwise {subject}
will be returned unchanged or NULL if an error occurred.

Version Description 5.1.0 Added the {count} parameter 4.0.4 Added the '$n'
form for the {replacement} parameter 4.0.2 Added the {limit} parameter

Using backreferences followed by numeric literals

<?php >
  $string = 'April 15, 2003';
  $pattern = '/(\w+) (\d+), (\d+)/i';
  $replacement = '${1}1,$3';
  echo preg_replace($pattern, $replacement, $string);
?>

The above example will output:

  April1,2003



Using indexed arrays with |preg_replace|

<?php >
  $string = 'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.';
  $patterns[0] = '/quick/';
  $patterns[1] = '/brown/';
  $patterns[2] = '/fox/';
  $replacements[2] = 'bear';
  $replacements[1] = 'black';
  $replacements[0] = 'slow';
  echo preg_replace($patterns, $replacements, $string);
?>

The above example will output:

  The bear black slow jumped over the lazy dog.

By ksorting patterns and replacements, we should get what we wanted.

<?php >
  ksort($patterns);
  ksort($replacements);
  echo preg_replace($patterns, $replacements, $string);
?>

The above example will output:

  The slow black bear jumped over the lazy dog.



Replacing several values

<?php >
  $patterns = array ('/(19|20)(\d{2})-(\d{1,2})-(\d{1,2})/',
                     '/^\s*{(\w+)}\s*=/');
  $replace = array ('\3/\4/\1\2', '$\1 =');
  echo preg_replace($patterns, $replace, '{startDate} = 1999-5-27');
?>

The above example will output:

  $startDate = 5/27/1999



Using the 'e' modifier

<?php >
  preg_replace("/(<\/?)(\w+)([^>]*>)/e", 
               "'\\1'.strtoupper('\\2').'\\3'", 
               $html_body);
?>

This would capitalize all HTML tags in the input text.





Strip whitespace This example strips excess whitespace from a string.

<?php >
  $str = 'foo   o';
  $str = preg_replace('/\s\s+/', ' ', $str);
  // This will be 'foo o' now
  echo $str;
?>



Using the {count} parameter

<?php >
  $count = 0;
  
  echo preg_replace(array('/\d/', '/\s/'), '*', 'xp 4 to', -1 , $count);
  echo $count; //3
?>

The above example will output:

  xp***to
  3



When using arrays with {pattern} and {replacement}, the keys are processed in
the order they appear in the array. This is not necessarily the same as the
numerical index order. If you use indexes to identify which {pattern} should
be replaced by which {replacement}, you should perform a |ksort| on each array
prior to calling |preg_replace|.
