ifx_connect -- Open Informix server connection

  resource ifx_connect([string database [, string userid [, string password]]])~

|ifx_connect| establishes a connection to an Informix server.

In case a second call is made to |ifx_connect| with the same arguments, no new
link will be established, but instead, the link identifier of the already
opened link will be returned.

The link to the server will be closed as soon as the execution of the script
ends, unless it's closed earlier by explicitly calling |ifx_close|.

All of the arguments are optional, and if they're missing, defaults are taken
from values supplied in php.ini (ifx.default_host for the host (Informix
libraries will use INFORMIXSERVER environment value if not defined),
ifx.default_user for user, ifx.default_password for the password (none if not
defined).

{database} The database name, as a string.

{userid} The username, as a string.

{password} The password, as a string.

Returns a connection identifier on success, or FALSE on error.
