sprintf -- Return a formatted string

  string sprintf(string format [, mixed args [, mixed ...]])~

Returns a string produced according to the formatting string {format}.

{format} The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary
characters (excluding %) that are copied directly to the result, and
conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching its own
parameter. This applies to both |sprintf| and |printf|.

Each conversion specification consists of a percent sign (%), followed by one
or more of these elements, in order: An optional sign specifier that forces a
sign (- or +) to be used on a number. By default, only the - sign is used on a
number if it's negative. This specifier forces positive numbers to have the +
sign attached as well, and was added in PHP 4.3.0.

An optional padding specifier that says what character will be used for
padding the results to the right string size. This may be a space character or
a 0 (zero character). The default is to pad with spaces. An alternate padding
character can be specified by prefixing it with a single quote ('). See the
examples below.

An optional alignment specifier that says if the result should be
left-justified or right-justified. The default is right-justified; a -
character here will make it left-justified.

An optional number, a width specifier that says how many characters (minimum)
this conversion should result in.

An optional precision specifier in the form of a period (`.') followed by an
optional decimal digit string that says how many decimal digits should be
displayed for floating-point numbers. When using this specifier on a string,
it acts as a cutoff point, setting a maximum character limit to the string.

A type specifier that says what type the argument data should be treated as.
Possible types: % - a literal percent character. No argument is required. b -
the argument is treated as an integer, and presented as a binary number. c -
the argument is treated as an integer, and presented as the character with
that ASCII value. d - the argument is treated as an integer, and presented as
a (signed) decimal number. e - the argument is treated as scientific notation
(e.g. 1.2e+2). The precision specifier stands for the number of digits after
the decimal point since PHP 5.2.1. In earlier versions, it was taken as number
of significant digits (one less). u - the argument is treated as an integer,
and presented as an unsigned decimal number. f - the argument is treated as a
float, and presented as a floating-point number (locale aware). F - the
argument is treated as a float, and presented as a floating-point number
(non-locale aware). Available since PHP 4.3.10 and PHP 5.0.3. o - the argument
is treated as an integer, and presented as an octal number. s - the argument
is treated as and presented as a string. x - the argument is treated as an
integer and presented as a hexadecimal number (with lowercase letters). X -
the argument is treated as an integer and presented as a hexadecimal number
(with uppercase letters).

The format string supports argument numbering/swapping. Here is an example:
Argument swapping

<?php >
  $format = 'There are %d monkeys in the %s';
  printf($format, $num, $location);
?>



This might output, "There are 5 monkeys in the tree". But imagine we are
creating a format string in a separate file, commonly because we would like to
internationalize it and we rewrite it as: Argument swapping

<?php >
  $format = 'The %s contains %d monkeys';
  printf($format, $num, $location);
?>



We now have a problem. The order of the placeholders in the format string does
not match the order of the arguments in the code. We would like to leave the
code as is and simply indicate in the format string which arguments the
placeholders refer to. We would write the format string like this instead:
Argument swapping

<?php >
  $format = 'The %2$s contains %1$d monkeys';
  printf($format, $num, $location);
?>



An added benefit here is that you can repeat the placeholders without adding
more arguments in the code. For example: Argument swapping

<?php >
  $format = 'The %2$s contains %1$d monkeys.
             That\'s a nice %2$s full of %1$d monkeys.';
  printf($format, $num, $location);
?>





{args}

{...}

Returns a string produced according to the formatting string {format}.

Version Description 4.0.6 Support for argument numbering/swapping was added

|printf|: various examples

<?php >
  $n =  43951789;
  $u = -43951789;
  $c = 65; // ASCII 65 is 'A'
  
  // notice the double %%, this prints a literal '%' character
  printf("%%b = '%b'\n", $n); // binary representation
  printf("%%c = '%c'\n", $c); // print the ascii character, same as chr() function
  printf("%%d = '%d'\n", $n); // standard integer representation
  printf("%%e = '%e'\n", $n); // scientific notation
  printf("%%u = '%u'\n", $n); // unsigned integer representation of a positive integer
  printf("%%u = '%u'\n", $u); // unsigned integer representation of a negative integer
  printf("%%f = '%f'\n", $n); // floating point representation
  printf("%%o = '%o'\n", $n); // octal representation
  printf("%%s = '%s'\n", $n); // string representation
  printf("%%x = '%x'\n", $n); // hexadecimal representation (lower-case)
  printf("%%X = '%X'\n", $n); // hexadecimal representation (upper-case)
  
  printf("%%+d = '%+d'\n", $n); // sign specifier on a positive integer
  printf("%%+d = '%+d'\n", $u); // sign specifier on a negative integer
?>

The above example will output:

  %b = '10100111101010011010101101'
  %c = 'A'
  %d = '43951789'
  %e = '4.39518e+7'
  %u = '43951789'
  %u = '4251015507'
  %f = '43951789.000000'
  %o = '247523255'
  %s = '43951789'
  %x = '29ea6ad'
  %X = '29EA6AD'
  %+d = '+43951789'
  %+d = '-43951789'

|printf|: string specifiers

<?php >
  $s = 'monkey';
  $t = 'many monkeys';
  
  printf("[%s]\n",      $s); // standard string output
  printf("[%10s]\n",    $s); // right-justification with spaces
  printf("[%-10s]\n",   $s); // left-justification with spaces
  printf("[%010s]\n",   $s); // zero-padding works on strings too
  printf("[%'#10s]\n",  $s); // use the custom padding character '#'
  printf("[%10.10s]\n", $t); // left-justification but with a cutoff of 10 characters
?>

The above example will output:

  [monkey]
  [    monkey]
  [monkey    ]
  [0000monkey]
  [####monkey]
  [many monke]

|sprintf|: zero-padded integers

<?php >
  $isodate = sprintf("%04d-%02d-%02d", $year, $month, $day);
?>



|sprintf|: formatting currency

<?php >
  $money1 = 68.75;
  $money2 = 54.35;
  $money = $money1 + $money2;
  // echo $money will output "123.1";
  $formatted = sprintf("%01.2f", $money);
  // echo $formatted will output "123.10"
?>



|sprintf|: scientific notation

<?php >
  $number = 362525200;
  
  echo sprintf("%.3e", $number); // outputs 3.625e+8
?>
