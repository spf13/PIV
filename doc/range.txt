range -- Create an array containing a range of elements

  array range(mixed low, mixed high [, number step])~

Create an array containing a range of elements.

{low} Low value.

{high} High value.

{step} If a {step} value is given, it will be used as the increment between
elements in the sequence. {step} should be given as a positive number. If not
specified, {step} will default to 1.

Returns an array of elements from {low} to {high}, inclusive. If low > high,
the sequence will be from high to low.

Version Description 5.0.0 The optional {step} parameter was added. 4.1.0 to
4.3.2 In PHP versions 4.1.0 through 4.3.2, |range| sees numeric strings as
strings and not integers. Instead, they will be used for character sequences.
For example, "4242" is treated as "4". 4.1.0 Prior to PHP 4.1.0, |range| only
generated incrementing integer arrays. Support for character sequences and
decrementing arrays was added in 4.1.0. Character sequence values are limited
to a length of one. If a length greater than one is entered, only the first
character is used.

|range| examples

<?php >
  // array(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12)
  foreach (range(0, 12) as $number) {
      echo $number;
  }
  
  // The step parameter was introduced in 5.0.0
  // array(0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100)
  foreach (range(0, 100, 10) as $number) {
      echo $number;
  }
  
  // Use of character sequences introduced in 4.1.0
  // array('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i');
  foreach (range('a', 'i') as $letter) {
      echo $letter;
  }
  // array('c', 'b', 'a');
  foreach (range('c', 'a') as $letter) {
      echo $letter;
  }
?>
