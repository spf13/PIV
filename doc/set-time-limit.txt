set_time_limit -- Limits the maximum execution time

  void set_time_limit(int seconds)~

Set the number of seconds a script is allowed to run. If this is reached, the
script returns a fatal error. The default limit is 30 seconds or, if it
exists, the max_execution_time value defined in the php.ini.

When called, |set_time_limit| restarts the timeout counter from zero. In other
words, if the timeout is the default 30 seconds, and 25 seconds into script
execution a call such as set_time_limit(20) is made, the script will run for a
total of 45 seconds before timing out.

{seconds} The maximum execution time, in seconds. If set to zero, no time
limit is imposed.

No value is returned.

This function has no effect when PHP is running in safe mode. There is no
workaround other than turning off safe mode or changing the time limit in the
php.ini.

The |set_time_limit| function and the configuration directive
max_execution_time only affect the execution time of the script itself. Any
time spent on activity that happens outside the execution of the script such
as system calls using |system|, stream operations, database queries, etc. is
not included when determining the maximum time that the script has been
running. This is not true on Windows where the measured time is real.
