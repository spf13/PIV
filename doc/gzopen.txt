gzopen -- Open gz-file

  resource gzopen(string filename, string mode [, int use_include_path])~

Opens a gzip (.gz) file for reading or writing.

|gzopen| can be used to read a file which is not in gzip format; in this case
|gzread| will directly read from the file without decompression.

{filename} The file name.

{mode} As in |fopen| (rb or wb) but can also include a compression level (wb9)
or a strategy: f for filtered data as in wb6f, h for Huffman only compression
as in wb1h. (See the description of deflateInit2 in zlib.h for more
information about the strategy parameter.)

{use_include_path} You can set this optional parameter to 1, if you want to
search for the file in the include_path too.

Returns a file pointer to the file opened, after that, everything you read
from this file descriptor will be transparently decompressed and what you
write gets compressed.

If the open fails, the function returns FALSE.

|gzopen| Example

<?php >
  $fp = gzopen("/tmp/file.gz", "r");
?>





|gzclose|
