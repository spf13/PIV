count -- Count all elements in an array, or properties in an object

  int count(mixed var [, int mode])~

Counts all elements in an array, or properties in an object.

For objects, if you have SPL installed, you can hook into |count| by
implementing interface Countable. The interface has exactly one method,
|count|, which returns the return value for the |count| function.

Please see the Array section of the manual for a detailed explanation of how
arrays are implemented and used in PHP.

{var} The array.

{mode} If the optional {mode} parameter is set to COUNT_RECURSIVE (or 1),
|count| will recursively count the array. This is particularly useful for
counting all the elements of a multidimensional array. The default value for
{mode} is 0. |count| does not detect infinite recursion.

Returns the number of elements in {var}, which is typically an array, since
anything else will have one element.

If {var} is not an array or an object with implemented Countable interface, 1
will be returned. There is one exception, if {var} is NULL, 0 will be
returned.

|count| may return 0 for a variable that isn't set, but it may also return 0
for a variable that has been initialized with an empty array. Use |isset| to
test if a variable is set.

Version Description 4.2.0 The optional {mode} parameter was added.

|count| example

<?php >
  $a[0] = 1;
  $a[1] = 3;
  $a[2] = 5;
  $result = count($a);
  // $result == 3
  
  $b[0]  = 7;
  $b[5]  = 9;
  $b[10] = 11;
  $result = count($b);
  // $result == 3
  
  $result = count(null);
  // $result == 0
  
  $result = count(false);
  // $result == 1
?>





Recursive |count| example

<?php >
  $food = array('fruits' => array('orange', 'banana', 'apple'),
                'veggie' => array('carrot', 'collard', 'pea'));
  
  // recursive count
  echo count($food, COUNT_RECURSIVE); // output 8
  
  // normal count
  echo count($food); // output 2
?>
