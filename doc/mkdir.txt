mkdir -- Makes directory

  bool mkdir(string pathname [, int mode [, bool recursive [, resource context]]])~

Attempts to create the directory specified by pathname.

{pathname} The directory path.

{mode} The mode is 0777 by default, which means the widest possible access.
For more information on modes, read the details on the |chmod| page.

{mode} is ignored on Windows.

Note that you probably want to specify the mode as an octal number, which
means it should have a leading zero. The mode is also modified by the current
umask, which you can change using |umask|.

{recursive} Default to FALSE.

{context} Context support was added with PHP 5.0.0. For a description of
contexts, refer to .

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

Version Description 5.0.0 The {recursive} parameter was added 5.0.0 As of PHP
5.0.0 |mkdir| can also be used with some URL wrappers. Refer to for a listing
of which wrappers support |mkdir| 4.2.0 The {mode} parameter became optional.

|mkdir| example

<?php >
  mkdir("/path/to/my/dir", 0700);
?>





When safe mode is enabled, PHP checks whether the directory in which the
script is operating has the same UID (owner) as the script that is being
executed.
