SDO_DAS_Relational::applyChanges -- Applies the changes made to a data graph
back to the database.

  void SDO_DAS_Relational::applyChanges(PDO database_handle, SDODataObject root_data_object)~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

Given a PDO database handle and the special root object of a data graph,
examine the change summary in the datagraph and applies the changes to the
database. The changes that it can apply can be creations of data objects,
deletes of data objects, and modifications to properties of data objects.

PDO_database_handle Constructed using the PDO extension. A typical line to
construct a PDO database handle might look like this:

  $dbh = new PDO("mysql:dbname=COMPANYDB;host=localhost",DATABASE_USER,DATABASE_PASSWORD);



root_data_object The special root object which is at the top of every SDO data
graph.

None. Note however that the datagraph that was passed is still intact and
usable. Furthermore, if data objects were created and written back to a table
with autogenerated primary keys, then those primary keys will now be set in
the data objects. If the changes were successfully written, then the change
summary associated with the datagraph will have been cleared, so that it is
possible to now make further changes to the data graph and apply those changes
in turn. In this way it is possible to work with the same data graph and apply
changes repeatedly.

|SDO_DAS_Relational::applyChanges| can throw an SDO_DAS_Relational_Exception
if it is unable to apply all the changes correctly.

The Relational DAS starts a database transaction before beginning to apply the
changes and will commit the transaction only if they are all successful. The
Relational DAS generates qualified update and delete statements which contain
a where clause that specifies that the row to be updated or deleted must
contain the same values that it did when the data was first retrieved. This is
how the the optimistic concurrency is implemented. If any of the qualified
update or delete statements fails to update or delete their target row, it may
be because the data has been altered in the database in the meantime. In any
event, if any update fails for any reason, the transaction is rolled back and
an exception thrown. The exception will contain the generated SQL statement
that failed.

The Relational DAS also catches any PDO exceptions and obtains PDO diagnostic
information which it includes in an SDO_DAS_Relational_Exception which it then
throws.

Please see the Examples section in the general information about the
Relational DAS for many examples of calling this method. Please see also the
section on Tracing to see how you can see what SQL statements are generated by
the Relational DAS.
