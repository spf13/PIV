socket_listen -- Listens for a connection on a socket

  bool socket_listen(resource socket [, int backlog])~

After the socket {socket} has been created using |socket_create| and bound to
a name with |socket_bind|, it may be told to listen for incoming connections
on {socket}.

|socket_listen| is applicable only to sockets of type SOCK_STREAM or
SOCK_SEQPACKET.

{socket} A valid socket resource created with |socket_create|.

{backlog} A maximum of {backlog} incoming connections will be queued for
processing. If a connection request arrives with the queue full the client may
receive an error with an indication of ECONNREFUSED, or, if the underlying
protocol supports retransmission, the request may be ignored so that retries
may succeed.

The maximum number passed to the {backlog} parameter highly depends on the
underlying platform. On Linux, it is silently truncated to SOMAXCONN. On
win32, if passed SOMAXCONN, the underlying service provider responsible for
the socket will set the backlog to a maximum reasonable value. There is no
standard provision to find out the actual backlog value on this platform.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure. The error code can be retrieved
with |socket_last_error|. This code may be passed to |socket_strerror| to get
a textual explanation of the error.
