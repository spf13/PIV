imagecreatefromxbm -- Create a new image from file or URL

  resource imagecreatefromxbm(string filename)~

|imagecreatefromxbm| returns an image identifier representing the image
obtained from the given filename.

You can use a URL as a filename with this function if the fopen wrappers have
been enabled. See |fopen| for more details on how to specify the filename and
for a list of supported URL protocols.

Windows versions of PHP prior to PHP 4.3.0 do not support accessing remote
files via this function, even if allow_url_fopen is enabled.
