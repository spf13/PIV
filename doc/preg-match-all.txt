preg_match_all -- Perform a global regular expression match

  int preg_match_all(string pattern, string subject, array matches [, int flags [, int offset]])~

Searches {subject} for all matches to the regular expression given in
{pattern} and puts them in {matches} in the order specified by {flags}.

After the first match is found, the subsequent searches are continued on from
end of the last match.

{pattern} The pattern to search for, as a string.

{subject} The input string.

{matches} Array of all matches in multi-dimensional array ordered according to
{flags}.

{flags} Can be a combination of the following flags (note that it doesn't make
sense to use PREG_PATTERN_ORDER together with PREG_SET_ORDER):
PREG_PATTERN_ORDER Orders results so that $matches[0] is an array of full
pattern matches, $matches[1] is an array of strings matched by the first
parenthesized subpattern, and so on.

<?php >
  preg_match_all("|<[^>]+>(.*)</[^>]+>|U",
      "<b>example: </b><div align=left>this is a test</div>",
      $out, PREG_PATTERN_ORDER);
  echo $out[0][0] . ", " . $out[0][1] . "\n";
  echo $out[1][0] . ", " . $out[1][1] . "\n";
?>

The above example will output:

  <b>example: </b>, <div align=left>this is a test</div>
  example: , this is a test

So, $out[0] contains array of strings that matched full pattern, and $out[1]
contains array of strings enclosed by tags.

PREG_SET_ORDER Orders results so that $matches[0] is an array of first set of
matches, $matches[1] is an array of second set of matches, and so on.

<?php >
  preg_match_all("|<[^>]+>(.*)</[^>]+>|U",
      "<b>example: </b><div align=\"left\">this is a test</div>",
      $out, PREG_SET_ORDER);
  echo $out[0][0] . ", " . $out[0][1] . "\n";
  echo $out[1][0] . ", " . $out[1][1] . "\n";
?>

The above example will output:

  <b>example: </b>, example:
  <div align="left">this is a test</div>, this is a test

PREG_OFFSET_CAPTURE If this flag is passed, for every occurring match the
appendant string offset will also be returned. Note that this changes the
value of {matches} in an array where every element is an array consisting of
the matched string at offset 0 and its string offset into {subject} at offset
1.

If no order flag is given, PREG_PATTERN_ORDER is assumed.

{offset} Normally, the search starts from the beginning of the subject string.
The optional parameter {offset} can be used to specify the alternate place
from which to start the search (in bytes).
