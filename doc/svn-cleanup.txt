svn_cleanup -- Recursively cleanup a working copy directory, finishing
incomplete operations and removing locks

  bool svn_cleanup(string workingdir)~

Recursively cleanup working copy directory {workingdir}, finishing any
incomplete operations and removing working copy locks. Use when a working copy
is in limbo and needs to be usable again.

{workingdir} String path to local working directory to cleanup

Relative paths will be resolved as if the current working directory was the
one that contains the PHP binary. To use the calling script"s working
directory, use |realpath| or dirname(__FILE__).

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

Basic example This example demonstrates clean up of a working copy in a
directory named help-me:

<?php >
  svn_cleanup(realpath('help-me'));
?>

The |realpath| call is necessary due to SVN's quirky handling of relative
paths.
