msg_receive -- Receive a message from a message queue

  bool msg_receive(resource queue, int desiredmsgtype, int msgtype, int maxsize, mixed message [, bool unserialize [, int flags [, int errorcode]]])~

|msg_receive| will receive the first message from the specified {queue} of the
type specified by {desiredmsgtype}.

{queue}

{desiredmsgtype} If {desiredmsgtype} is 0, the message from the front of the
queue is returned. If {desiredmsgtype} is greater than 0, then the first
message of that type is returned. If {desiredmsgtype} is less than 0, the
first message on the queue with the lowest type less than or equal to the
absolute value of {desiredmsgtype} will be read. If no messages match the
criteria, your script will wait until a suitable message arrives on the queue.
You can prevent the script from blocking by specifying MSG_IPC_NOWAIT in the
{flags} parameter.

{msgtype} The type of the message that was received will be stored in this
parameter.

{maxsize} The maximum size of message to be accepted is specified by the
{maxsize}; if the message in the queue is larger than this size the function
will fail (unless you set {flags} as described below).

{message} The received message will be stored in {message}, unless there were
errors receiving the message.

{unserialize} {unserialize} defaults to TRUE; if it is set to TRUE, the
message is treated as though it was serialized using the same mechanism as the
session module. The message will be unserialized and then returned to your
script. This allows you to easily receive arrays or complex object structures
from other PHP scripts, or if you are using the WDDX serializer, from any WDDX
compatible source.

If {unserialize} is FALSE, the message will be returned as a binary-safe
string.

{flags} The optional {flags} allows you to pass flags to the low-level msgrcv
system call. It defaults to 0, but you may specify one or more of the
following values (by adding or ORing them together). Flag values for
msg_receive MSG_IPC_NOWAIT If there are no messages of the {desiredmsgtype},
return immediately and do not wait. The function will fail and return an
integer value corresponding to MSG_ENOMSG. MSG_EXCEPT Using this flag in
combination with a {desiredmsgtype} greater than 0 will cause the function to
receive the first message that is not equal to {desiredmsgtype}. MSG_NOERROR
If the message is longer than {maxsize}, setting this flag will truncate the
message to {maxsize} and will not signal an error.

{errorcode} If the function fails, the optional {errorcode} will be set to the
value of the system errno variable.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

Upon successful completion the message queue data structure is updated as
follows: msg_lrpid is set to the process-ID of the calling process, msg_qnum
is decremented by 1 and msg_rtime is set to the current time.
