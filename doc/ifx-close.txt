ifx_close -- Close Informix connection

  bool ifx_close([resource link_identifier])~

|ifx_close| closes the link to an Informix database that's associated with the
specified link identifier.

Note that this isn't usually necessary, as non-persistent open links are
automatically closed at the end of the script's execution.

|ifx_close| will not close persistent links generated by |ifx_pconnect|.

{link_identifier} The link identifier. If not specified, the last opened link
is assumed.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
