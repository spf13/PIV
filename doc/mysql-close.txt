mysql_close -- Close MySQL connection

  bool mysql_close([resource link_identifier])~

|mysql_close| closes the non-persistent connection to the MySQL server that's
associated with the specified link identifier. If {link_identifier} isn't
specified, the last opened link is used.

Using |mysql_close| isn't usually necessary, as non-persistent open links are
automatically closed at the end of the script's execution. See also freeing
resources.

{ link_identifier}The MySQL connection. If the link identifier is not
specified, the last link opened by |mysql_connect| is assumed. If no such link
is found, it will try to create one as if |mysql_connect| was called with no
arguments. If by chance no connection is found or established, an E_WARNING
level error is generated.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

|mysql_close| example

<?php >
  $link = mysql_connect('localhost', 'mysql_user', 'mysql_password');
  if (!$link) {
      die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error());
  }
  echo 'Connected successfully';
  mysql_close($link);
?>

The above example will output:

  Connected successfully



|mysql_close| will not close persistent links created by |mysql_pconnect|.
