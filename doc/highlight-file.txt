highlight_file -- Syntax highlighting of a file

  mixed highlight_file(string filename [, bool return])~

Prints out or returns a syntax highlighted version of the code contained in
{filename} using the colors defined in the built-in syntax highlighter for
PHP.

Many servers are configured to automatically highlight files with a phps
extension. For example, example.phps when viewed will show the syntax
highlighted source of the file. To enable this, add this line to the
httpd.conf:



  AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps

{filename} Path to the PHP file to be highlighted.

{return} Set this parameter to TRUE to make this function return the
highlighted code.

If {return} is set to TRUE, returns the highlighted code as a string instead
of printing it out. Otherwise, it will return TRUE on success, FALSE on
failure.

Version Description 4.2.1 This function is now also affected by safe_mode and
open_basedir. 4.2.0 The {return} parameter was added.

Care should be taken when using the |highlight_file| function to make sure
that you do not inadvertently reveal sensitive information such as passwords
or any other type of information that might create a potential security risk.

This function uses internal output buffering with this parameter so it can not
be used inside an |ob_start| callback function.
