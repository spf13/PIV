This function has been DEPRECATED as of PHP 5.3.0 and REMOVED as of PHP 6.0.0.
Relying on this feature is highly discouraged.

{name} The variable name.

|session_is_registered| returns TRUE if there is a global variable with the
name {name} registered in the current session, FALSE otherwise.

If $_SESSION (or $HTTP_SESSION_VARS for PHP 4.0.6 or less) is used, use
|isset| to check a variable is registered in $_SESSION.

If you are using $_SESSION (or $HTTP_SESSION_VARS), do not use
|session_register|, |session_is_registered| and |session_unregister|.
