imagealphablending -- Set the blending mode for an image

  bool imagealphablending(resource image, bool blendmode)~

|imagealphablending| allows for two different modes of drawing on truecolor
images. In blending mode, the alpha channel component of the color supplied to
all drawing function, such as |imagesetpixel| determines how much of the
underlying color should be allowed to shine through. As a result, gd
automatically blends the existing color at that point with the drawing color,
and stores the result in the image. The resulting pixel is opaque. In
non-blending mode, the drawing color is copied literally with its alpha
channel information, replacing the destination pixel. Blending mode is not
available when drawing on palette images.

{ image}An image resource, returned by one of the image creation functions,
such as |imagecreatetruecolor|.

{blendmode} Whether to enable the blending mode or not. Default to FALSE.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

|imagealphablending| usage example

<?php >
  // Create image
  $im = imagecreatetruecolor(100, 100);
  
  // Set alphablending to on
  imagealphablending($im, true);
  
  // Draw a square
  imagefilledrectangle($im, 30, 30, 70, 70, imagecolorallocate($im, 255, 0, 0));
  
  // Output
  header('Content-type: image/png');
  
  imagepng($im);
  imagedestroy($im);
?>



This function requires GD 2.0.1 or later (2.0.28 or later is recommended).
