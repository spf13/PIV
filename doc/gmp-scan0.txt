gmp_scan0 -- Scan for 0

  int gmp_scan0(resource a, int start)~

Scans {a}, starting with bit {start}, towards more significant bits, until the
first clear bit is found.

{a} The number to scan.

It can be either a GMP number resource, or a numeric string given that it is
possible to convert the latter to a number.

{start} The starting bit.

Returns the index of the found bit, as an integer. The index starts from 0.

|gmp_scan0| example

<?php >
  // "0" bit is found at position 3. index starts at 0
  $s1 = gmp_init("10111", 2);
  echo gmp_scan0($s1, 0) . "\n";
  
  // "0" bit is found at position 7. index starts at 5
  $s2 = gmp_init("101110000", 2);
  echo gmp_scan0($s2, 5) . "\n";
?>

The above example will output:
