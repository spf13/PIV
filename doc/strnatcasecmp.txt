strnatcasecmp -- Case insensitive string comparisons using a "natural order"
algorithm

  int strnatcasecmp(string str1, string str2)~

This function implements a comparison algorithm that orders alphanumeric
strings in the way a human being would. The behaviour of this function is
similar to |strnatcmp|, except that the comparison is not case sensitive. For
more information see: Martin Pool's Natural Order String Comparison page.

{str1} The first string.

{str2} The second string.
