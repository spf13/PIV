dbx_fetch_row -- Fetches rows from a query-result that had the
DBX_RESULT_UNBUFFERED flag set

  mixed dbx_fetch_row(object result_identifier)~

|dbx_fetch_row| fetches rows from a result identifier that had the
DBX_RESULT_UNBUFFERED flag set.

When the DBX_RESULT_UNBUFFERED is not set in the query, |dbx_fetch_row| will
fail as all rows have already been fetched into the results data property.

As a side effect, the rows property of the query-result object is incremented
for each successful call to |dbx_fetch_row|.

{result_identifier} A result set returned by |dbx_query|.

Returns an object on success that contains the same information as any row
would have in the |dbx_query| result data property, including columns
accessible by index or fieldname when the flags for |dbx_query| were set that
way.

Upon failure, returns 0 (e.g. when no more rows are available).

How to handle the returned value

<?php >
  $result = dbx_query($link, 'SELECT id, parentid, description FROM table', DBX_RESULT_UNBUFFERED);
  
  echo "<table>\n";
  while ($row = dbx_fetch_row($result)) {
      echo "<tr>\n";
      foreach ($row as $field) {
          echo "<td>$field</td>";
      }
      echo "</tr>\n";
  }
  echo "</table>\n";
?>
