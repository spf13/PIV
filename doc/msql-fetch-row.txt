msql_fetch_row -- Get row as enumerated array

specified query identifier. The row is returned as an array. Each result
column is stored in an array offset, starting at offset 0.

Subsequent call to |msql_fetch_row| would return the next row in the result
set, or FALSE if there are no more rows.

call to |msql_query|.

Returns an array that corresponds to the fetched row, or FALSE if there are no
more rows.

<?php >
  $con = msql_connect();
  if (!$con) {
      die('Server connection problem: ' . msql_error());
  }
  
  if (!msql_select_db('test', $con)) {
      die('Database connection problem: ' . msql_error());
  }
  
  $result = msql_query('SELECT id, name FROM people', $con);
  if (!$result) {
      die('Query execution problem: ' . msql_error());
  }
  
  while ($row = msql_fetch_row($result)) {
      echo $row[0] . ': ' . $row[1] . "\n";
  }
  
  msql_free_result($result);
?>
