str_rot13 -- Perform the rot13 transform on a string

  string str_rot13(string str)~

Performs the ROT13 encoding on the {str} argument and returns the resulting
string.

The ROT13 encoding simply shifts every letter by 13 places in the alphabet
while leaving non-alpha characters untouched. Encoding and decoding are done
by the same function, passing an encoded string as argument will return the
original version.

{str} The input string.

Returns the ROT13 version of the given string.

|str_rot13| example

<?php >
  echo str_rot13('PHP 4.3.0'); // CUC 4.3.0
?>





Version Description 4.3.0 The behaviour of this function was fixed. Before
this fix, the {str} was also modified, as if it was passed by reference.
