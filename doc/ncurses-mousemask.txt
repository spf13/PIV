  int ncurses_mousemask(int newmask, int oldmask)~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

Sets mouse events to be reported. By default no mouse events will be reported.

Mouse events are represented by NCURSES_KEY_MOUSE in the |ncurses_wgetch|
input stream. To read the event data and pop the event of queue, call
|ncurses_getmouse|.

{newmask} Mouse mask options can be set with the following predefined
constants: NCURSES_BUTTON1_PRESSED

NCURSES_BUTTON1_RELEASED

NCURSES_BUTTON1_CLICKED

NCURSES_BUTTON1_DOUBLE_CLICKED

NCURSES_BUTTON1_TRIPLE_CLICKED

NCURSES_BUTTON2_PRESSED

NCURSES_BUTTON2_RELEASED

NCURSES_BUTTON2_CLICKED

NCURSES_BUTTON2_DOUBLE_CLICKED

NCURSES_BUTTON2_TRIPLE_CLICKED

NCURSES_BUTTON3_PRESSED

NCURSES_BUTTON3_RELEASED

NCURSES_BUTTON3_CLICKED

NCURSES_BUTTON3_DOUBLE_CLICKED

NCURSES_BUTTON3_TRIPLE_CLICKED

NCURSES_BUTTON4_PRESSED

NCURSES_BUTTON4_RELEASED

NCURSES_BUTTON4_CLICKED

NCURSES_BUTTON4_DOUBLE_CLICKED

NCURSES_BUTTON4_TRIPLE_CLICKED

NCURSES_BUTTON_SHIFT>

NCURSES_BUTTON_CTRL

NCURSES_BUTTON_ALT

NCURSES_ALL_MOUSE_EVENTS

NCURSES_REPORT_MOUSE_POSITION

As a side effect, setting a zero mousemask in {newmask} turns off the mouse
pointer. Setting a non zero value turns mouse pointer on.

{oldmask} This will be set to the previous value of the mouse event mask.

Returns a mask to indicated which of the in parameter {newmask} specified
mouse events can be reported. On complete failure, it returns 0.
