htmlspecialchars -- Convert special characters to HTML entities

  string htmlspecialchars(string string [, int quote_style [, string charset [, bool double_encode]]])~

Certain characters have special significance in HTML, and should be
represented by HTML entities if they are to preserve their meanings. This
function returns a string with some of these conversions made; the
translations made are those most useful for everyday web programming. If you
require all HTML character entities to be translated, use |htmlentities|
instead.

This function is useful in preventing user-supplied text from containing HTML
markup, such as in a message board or guest book application.
