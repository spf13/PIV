glob -- Find pathnames matching a pattern

  array glob(string pattern [, int flags])~

The |glob| function searches for all the pathnames matching {pattern}
according to the rules used by the libc glob() function, which is similar to
the rules used by common shells.

{pattern} The pattern. No tilde expansion or parameter substitution is done.

{flags} Valid flags: GLOB_MARK - Adds a slash to each directory returned

GLOB_NOSORT - Return files as they appear in the directory (no sorting)

GLOB_NOCHECK - Return the search pattern if no files matching it were found

GLOB_NOESCAPE - Backslashes do not quote metacharacters

GLOB_BRACE - Expands {a,b,c} to match 'a', 'b', or 'c'

GLOB_ONLYDIR - Return only directory entries which match the pattern

GLOB_ERR - Stop on read errors (like unreadable directories), by default
errors are ignored.

Returns an array containing the matched files/directories, an empty array if
no file matched or FALSE on error.

On some systems it is impossible to distinguish between empty match and an
error.

Version Description 5.1.0 GLOB_ERR was added 4.3.3 GLOB_ONLYDIR became
available on Windows and other systems not using the GNU C library

Convenient way how |glob| can replace |opendir| and friends.

<?php >
  foreach (glob("*.txt") as $filename) {
      echo "$filename size " . filesize($filename) . "\n";
  }
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  funclist.txt size 44686
  funcsummary.txt size 267625
  quickref.txt size 137820



This function will not work on remote files as the file to be examined must be
accessible via the server"s filesystem.

This function isn't available on some systems (e.g. old Sun OS).

The GLOB_BRACE flag is not available on some non GNU systems, like Solaris.
