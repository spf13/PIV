SQLiteDatabase->query -- Executes a query against a given database and returns
a result handle

  resource sqlite_query(resource dbhandle, string query [, int result_type [, string error_msg]])~

  resource sqlite_query(resource dbhandle, string query [, int result_type [, string error_msg, string query, resource dbhandle [, int result_type [, string error_msg]]]])~

Object oriented style (method):

  SQLiteResult query(resource dbhandle, string query [, int result_type [, string error_msg, string query, resource dbhandle [, int result_type [, string error_msg, string query [, int result_type [, string error_msg]]]]]])~

Executes an SQL statement given by the {query} against a given database
handle.

{dbhandle} The SQLite Database resource; returned from |sqlite_open| when used
procedurally. This parameter is not required when using the object-oriented
method.

{query} The query to be executed.

{result_type} The optional {result_type} parameter accepts a constant and
determines how the returned array will be indexed. Using SQLITE_ASSOC will
return only associative indices (named fields) while SQLITE_NUM will return
only numerical indices (ordinal field numbers). SQLITE_BOTH will return both
associative and numerical indices. SQLITE_BOTH is the default for this
function.

{error_msg} The specified variable will be filled if an error occurs. This is
specially important because SQL syntax errors can't be fetched using the
|sqlite_last_error| function.

Two alternative syntaxes are supported for compatibility with other database
extensions (such as MySQL). The preferred form is the first, where the
{dbhandle} parameter is the first parameter to the function.

This function will return a result handle or FALSE on failure. For queries
that return rows, the result handle can then be used with functions such as
|sqlite_fetch_array| and |sqlite_seek|.

Regardless of the query type, this function will return FALSE if the query
failed.

|sqlite_query| returns a buffered, seekable result handle. This is useful for
reasonably small queries where you need to be able to randomly access the
rows. Buffered result handles will allocate memory to hold the entire result
and will not return until it has been fetched. If you only need sequential
access to the data, it is recommended that you use the much higher performance
|sqlite_unbuffered_query| instead.

Version Description 5.1.0 Added the {error_msg} parameter

SQLite will execute multiple queries separated by semicolons, so you can use
it to execute a batch of SQL that you have loaded from a file or have embedded
in a script. However, this works only when the result of the function is not
used - if it is used, only the first SQL statement would be executed. Function
|sqlite_exec| will always execute multiple SQL statements.

When executing multiple queries, the return value of this function will be
FALSE if there was an error, but undefined otherwise (it might be TRUE for
success or it might return a result handle).
