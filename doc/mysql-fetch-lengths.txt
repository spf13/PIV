mysql_fetch_lengths -- Get the length of each output in a result

  array mysql_fetch_lengths(resource result)~

Returns an array that corresponds to the lengths of each field in the last row
fetched by MySQL.

|mysql_fetch_lengths| stores the lengths of each result column in the last row
returned by |mysql_fetch_row|, |mysql_fetch_assoc|, |mysql_fetch_array|, and
|mysql_fetch_object| in an array, starting at offset 0.

{ result}The result resource that is being evaluated. This result comes from a
call to |mysql_query|.

An array of lengths on success, or FALSE on failure.

A |mysql_fetch_lengths| example

<?php >
  $result = mysql_query("SELECT id,email FROM people WHERE id = '42'");
  if (!$result) {
      echo 'Could not run query: ' . mysql_error();
      exit;
  }
  $row     = mysql_fetch_assoc($result);
  $lengths = mysql_fetch_lengths($result);
  
  print_r($row);
  print_r($lengths);
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  Array
  (
      [id] => 42
      [email] => user@example.com
  )
  Array
  (
      [0] => 2
      [1] => 16
  )
