pg_convert -- Convert associative array values into suitable for SQL statement

  array pg_convert(resource connection, string table_name, array assoc_array [, int options])~

|pg_convert| checks and converts the values in {assoc_array} into suitable
values for use in a SQL statement. Precondition for |pg_convert| is the
existence of a table {table_name} which has at least as many columns as
{assoc_array} has elements. The fieldnames in {table_name} must match the
indices in {assoc_array} and the corresponding datatypes must be compatible.
Returns an array with the converted values on success, FALSE otherwise.

If there are boolean fields in {table_name} don't use the constant TRUE in
{assoc_array}. It will be converted to the string 'TRUE' which is no valid
entry for boolean fields in PostgreSQL. Use one of t, true, 1, y, yes instead.

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

{connection} PostgreSQL database connection resource.

{table_name} Name of the table against which to convert types.

{assoc_array} Data to be converted.

{options} Any number of PGSQL_CONV_IGNORE_DEFAULT, PGSQL_CONV_FORCE_NULL or
PGSQL_CONV_IGNORE_NOT_NULL, combined.

An array of converted values, or FALSE on error.
