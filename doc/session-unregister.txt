session_unregister -- Unregister a global variable from the current session

  bool session_unregister(string name)~

|session_unregister| unregisters the global variable named {name} from the
current session.

This function has been DEPRECATED as of PHP 5.3.0 and REMOVED as of PHP 6.0.0.
Relying on this feature is highly discouraged.

{name} The variable name.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

If $_SESSION (or $HTTP_SESSION_VARS for PHP 4.0.6 or less) is used, use
|unset| to unregister a session variable. Do not |unset| $_SESSION itself as
this will disable the special function of the $_SESSION superglobal.

This function does not unset the corresponding global variable for {name}, it
only prevents the variable from being saved as part of the session. You must
call |unset| to remove the corresponding global variable.

If you are using $_SESSION (or $HTTP_SESSION_VARS), do not use
|session_register|, |session_is_registered| and |session_unregister|.
