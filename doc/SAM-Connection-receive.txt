SAMConnection->receive -- Receive a message from a queue or subscription.

  SAMMessage receive(string target [, array properties])~

{target} The identity of the queue, topic or subscription from which to
receive the message.

{properties} An optional associative array of properties describing other
parameters to control the receive operation. Property name Possible values
SAM_CORRELID Used to request selection of the message to receive based upon
the correlation id string of the message. SAM_MESSAGEID Used to request
selection of the message to receive based upon the message id string of the
message. SAM_WAIT Timeout value in milliseconds to control how long the
request should block waiting to receive a message before returning with a
failure if no message is available on the queue or topic. The default value is
0 meaning wait indefinitely and should be used with caution as the request may
wait until the overall PHP script processing time limit has expired if no
message becomes available.

This method returns a SAMMessage object or FALSE if an error occurs.

Receiving a message from a queue

<?php >
  $msg = $conn->receive('queue://receive/test');
  
  if (!$msg) {
    // The receive failed!
    echo "Receive failed ($conn->errno) $conn->error";
  }
?>





Receiving a message from a queue with options In this example the SAM_CORRELID
option is used to specify a correlation id string to be used to identify the
message to receive. A wait timeout of 10 seconds is also specified.

<?php >
  $msg = $conn->receive('queue://receive/test', array(SAM_CORRELID => $token, SAM_WAIT => 10000));
?>



Receiving a message from a subscription In this example we show how to receive
a message from a subscription id.

<?php >
  $msg = $conn->receive($subscriptionName);
  
  if (!$msg) {
    // The receive failed!
    echo "Receive failed ($conn->errno) $conn->error";
  }
?>

Please note that $subscriptionName is a subscription id returned from an
earlier subscribe call.
