session_name -- Get and/or set the current session name

  string session_name([string name])~

|session_name| returns the name of the current session.

The session name is reset to the default value stored in session.name at
request startup time. Thus, you need to call |session_name| for every request
(and before |session_start| or |session_register| are called).

{name} The session name references the session id in cookies and URLs. It
should contain only alphanumeric characters; it should be short and
descriptive (i.e. for users with enabled cookie warnings). If {name} is
specified, the name of the current session is changed to its value.

The session name can't consist of digits only, at least one letter must be
present. Otherwise a new session id is generated every time.

Returns the name of the current session.

|session_name| example

<?php >
  /* set the session name to WebsiteID */
  
  $previous_name = session_name("WebsiteID");
  
  echo "The previous session name was $previous_name<br />";
?>
