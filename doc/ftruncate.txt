ftruncate -- Truncates a file to a given length

  bool ftruncate(resource handle, int size)~

Takes the filepointer, {handle}, and truncates the file to length, {size}.

{handle} The file pointer.

The {handle} must be open for writing.

{size} The size to truncate to.

If {size} is larger than the file it is extended with null bytes.

If {size} is smaller than the extra data will be lost.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

Version Description PHP 4.3.3 Prior to this release |ftruncate| returned an
integer value of 1 on success, instead of boolean TRUE.

File truncation example

<?php >
  $filename = 'lorem_ipsum.txt';
  
  $handle = fopen($filename, 'r+');
  ftruncate($handle, rand(1, filesize($filename)));
  rewind($handle);
  echo fread($handle, filesize($filename));
  fclose($handle);
?>





The file pointer is not changed.

|fopen| |fseek|
