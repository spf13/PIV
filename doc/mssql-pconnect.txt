mssql_pconnect -- Open persistent MS SQL connection

  resource mssql_pconnect([string servername [, string username [, string password [, bool new_link]]]])~

|mssql_pconnect| acts very much like |mssql_connect| with two major
differences.

First, when connecting, the function would first try to find a (persistent)
link that's already open with the same host, username and password. If one is
found, an identifier for it will be returned instead of opening a new
connection.

Second, the connection to the SQL server will not be closed when the execution
of the script ends. Instead, the link will remain open for future use
(|mssql_close| will not close links established by |mssql_pconnect|).

This type of links is therefore called 'persistent'.

{servername} The MS SQL server. It can also include a port number. e.g.
hostname:port.

{username} The username.

{password} The password.

{new_link} If a second call is made to |mssql_pconnect| with the same
arguments, no new link will be established, but instead, the link identifier
of the already opened link will be returned. This parameter modifies this
behavior and makes |mssql_pconnect| always open a new link, even if
|mssql_pconnect| was called before with the same parameters.

Returns a positive MS SQL persistent link identifier on success, or FALSE on
error.

|mssql_pconnect| using the {new_link} parameter

<?php >
  // Connect to the database server
  $link1 = mssql_pconnect('MANGO\SQLEXPRESS', 'sa', 'phpfi');
  mssql_select_db('php', $link1);
  
  // Create a new link
  $link2 = mssql_pconnect('MANGO\SQLEXPRESS', 'sa', 'phpfi', true);
  mssql_select_db('random', $link2);
?>
