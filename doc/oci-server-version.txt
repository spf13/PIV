|oci_server_version| example

<?php >
      $conn = oci_connect("scott", "tiger");
      echo "Server Version: " . oci_server_version($conn);
      oci_close($conn);
?>





In PHP versions before 5.0.0 you must use |ociserverversion| instead. This
name still can be used, it was left as alias of |oci_server_version| for
downwards compatability. This, however, is deprecated and not recommended.
