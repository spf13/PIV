hw_GetText -- Retrieve text document

  int hw_gettext(int connection, int objectID [, mixed rootID/prefix])~

Returns the document with object ID {objectID}. If the document has anchors
which can be inserted, they will be inserted already.

This function will only work for pure text documents. It will not open a
special data connection and therefore blocks the control connection during the
transfer.

{connection} The connection identifier.

{objectID} The object identifier.
