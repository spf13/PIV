hw_Modifyobject -- Modifies object record

  bool hw_modifyobject(int connection, int object_to_change, array remove, array add [, int mode])~

This command allows to remove, add, or modify individual attributes of an
object record. The object is specified by the Object ID {object_to_change}. In
order to modify an attribute one will have to remove the old one and add a new
one. |hw_modifyobject| will always remove the attributes before it adds
attributes unless the value of the attribute to remove is not a string or
array.

The keys of both arrays are the attributes name. The value of each array
element can either be an array, a string or anything else. If it is an array
each attribute value is constructed by the key of each element plus a colon
and the value of each element. If it is a string it is taken as the attribute
value. An empty string will result in a complete removal of that attribute. If
the value is neither a string nor an array but something else, e.g. an
integer, no operation at all will be performed on the attribute. This is
necessary if you want to add a completely new attribute not just a new value
for an existing attribute. If the remove array contained an empty string for
that attribute, the attribute would be tried to be removed which would fail
since it doesn't exist. The following addition of a new value for that
attribute would also fail. Setting the value for that attribute to e.g. 0
would not even try to remove it and the addition will work.

If you would like to change the attribute 'Name' with the current value
'books' into 'articles' you will have to create two arrays and call
|hw_modifyobject|. modifying an attribute

<?php >
         // $connect is an existing connection to the Hyperwave server
         // $objid is the ID of the object to modify
         $remarr = array("Name" => "books");
         $addarr = array("Name" => "articles");
         $hw_modifyobject($connect, $objid, $remarr, $addarr);
?>



In order to delete/add a name=value pair from/to the object record just pass
the remove/add array and set the last/third parameter to an empty array. If
the attribute is the first one with that name to add, set attribute value in
the remove array to an integer. adding a completely new attribute

<?php >
         // $connect is an existing connection to the Hyperwave server
         // $objid is the ID of the object to modify
         $remarr = array("Name" => 0);
         $addarr = array("Name" => "articles");
         $hw_modifyobject($connect, $objid, $remarr, $addarr);
?>





Multilingual attributes, e.g. 'Title', can be modified in two ways. Either by
providing the attributes value in its native form 'language':'title' or by
providing an array with elements for each language as described above. The
above example would than be:

modifying Title attribute

<?php >
         $remarr = array("Title" => "en:Books");
         $addarr = array("Title" => "en:Articles");
         $hw_modifyobject($connect, $objid, $remarr, $addarr);
?>



or modifying Title attribute

<?php >
         $remarr = array("Title" => array("en" => "Books"));
         $addarr = array("Title" => array("en" => "Articles", "ge"=>"Artikel"));
         $hw_modifyobject($connect, $objid, $remarr, $addarr);
?>



This removes the English title 'Books' and adds the English title 'Articles'
and the German title 'Artikel'. removing attribute

<?php >
         $remarr = array("Title" => "");
         $addarr = array("Title" => "en:Articles");
         $hw_modifyobject($connect, $objid, $remarr, $addarr);
?>



This will remove all attributes with the name 'Title' and adds a new 'Title'
attribute. This comes in handy if you want to remove attributes recursively.

If you need to delete all attributes with a certain name you will have to pass
an empty string as the attribute value.

Only the attributes 'Title', 'Description' and 'Keyword' will properly handle
the language prefix. If those attributes don't carry a language prefix, the
prefix 'xx' will be assigned.

The 'Name' attribute is somewhat special. In some cases it cannot be complete
removed. You will get an error message 'Change of base attribute' (not clear
when this happens). Therefore you will always have to add a new Name first and
than remove the old one.

You may not surround this function by calls to |hw_getandlock| and
|hw_unlock|. |hw_modifyobject| does this internally.

{connection} The connection identifier.

{object_to_change} The object to be changed.

{remove} An array of attributes to remove.

{add} An array of attributes to add.

{mode} The last parameter determines if the modification is performed
recursively. 1 means recursive modification. If some of the objects cannot be
modified they will be skipped without notice. |hw_error| may not indicate an
error though some of the objects could not be modified.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
