fread -- Binary-safe file read

  string fread(resource handle, int length)~

|fread| reads up to {length} bytes from the file pointer referenced by
{handle}. Reading stops as soon as one of the following conditions is met:
{length} bytes have been read

EOF (end of file) is reached

a packet becomes available (for network streams)

8192 bytes have been read (after opening userspace stream)

{handle} A file system pointer resource that is typically created using
|fopen|.

{length} Up to {length} number of bytes read.

Returns the read string or FALSE in case of error.

A simple |fread| example

<?php >
  // get contents of a file into a string
  $filename = "/usr/local/something.txt";
  $handle = fopen($filename, "r");
  $contents = fread($handle, filesize($filename));
  fclose($handle);
?>





Binary |fread| example On systems which differentiate between binary and text
files (i.e. Windows) the file must be opened with 'b' included in |fopen| mode
parameter.

<?php >
  $filename = "c:\\files\\somepic.gif";
  $handle = fopen($filename, "rb");
  $contents = fread($handle, filesize($filename));
  fclose($handle);
?>



Remote |fread| examples When reading from anything that is not a regular local
file, such as streams returned when reading remote files or from |popen| and
|fsockopen|, reading will stop after a packet is available. This means that
you should collect the data together in chunks as shown in the examples below.

<?php >
  // For PHP 5 and up
  $handle = fopen("http://www.example.com/", "rb");
  $contents = stream_get_contents($handle);
  fclose($handle);
?>

<?php >
  $handle = fopen("http://www.example.com/", "rb");
  $contents = '';
  while (!feof($handle)) {
    $contents .= fread($handle, 8192);
  }
  fclose($handle);
?>



If you just want to get the contents of a file into a string, use
|file_get_contents| as it has much better performance than the code above.

Note that |fread| reads from the current position of the file pointer. Use
|ftell| to find the current position of the pointer and |rewind| to rewind the
pointer position.

|fwrite| |fopen| |fsockopen| |popen| |fgets| |fgetss| |fscanf| |file|
|fpassthru| |ftell| |rewind|
