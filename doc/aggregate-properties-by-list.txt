aggregate_properties_by_list -- Selective dynamic class properties aggregation
to an object

  void aggregate_properties_by_list(object object, string class_name, array properties_list [, bool exclude])~

Aggregates properties from a class to an existing object using a list of
property names.

The properties whose names start with an underscore character (_), which are
considered private to the aggregated class, are always excluded.

{object}

{class_name}

{properties_list}

{exclude} The optional parameter {exclude} is used to decide whether the list
contains the names of class properties to include in the aggregation (i.e.
{exclude} is FALSE, which is the default value), or to exclude from the
aggregation ({exclude} is TRUE).

No value is returned.
