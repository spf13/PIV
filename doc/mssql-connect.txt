mssql_connect -- Open MS SQL server connection

  resource mssql_connect([string servername [, string username [, string password [, bool new_link]]]])~

|mssql_connect| establishes a connection to a MS SQL server.

The link to the server will be closed as soon as the execution of the script
ends, unless it's closed earlier by explicitly calling |mssql_close|.

{servername} The MS SQL server. It can also include a port number. e.g.
hostname,port.

{username} The username.

{password} The password.

{new_link} If a second call is made to |mssql_connect| with the same
arguments, no new link will be established, but instead, the link identifier
of the already opened link will be returned. This parameter modifies this
behavior and makes |mssql_connect| always open a new link, even if
|mssql_connect| was called before with the same parameters.

Returns a MS SQL link identifier on success, or FALSE on error.

Version Description 4.4.1 and 5.1.0 The {new_link} parameter was added

|mssql_connect| example

<?php >
  // Server in the this format: <computer>\<instance name> or 
  // <server>,<port> when using a non default port number
  $server = 'KALLESPC\SQLEXPRESS';
  
  $link = mssql_connect($server, 'sa', 'phpfi');
  
  if(!$link)
  {
  	die('Something went wrong while connecting to MSSQL');
  }
?>
