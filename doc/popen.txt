popen -- Opens process file pointer

  resource popen(string command, string mode)~

Opens a pipe to a process executed by forking the command given by command.

{command} The command

{mode} The mode

Returns a file pointer identical to that returned by |fopen|, except that it
is unidirectional (may only be used for reading or writing) and must be closed
with |pclose|. This pointer may be used with |fgets|, |fgetss|, and |fwrite|.

If an error occurs, returns FALSE.

|popen| example

<?php >
  $handle = popen("/bin/ls", "r");
?>





If the command to be executed could not be found, a valid resource is
returned. This may seem odd, but makes sense; it allows you to access any
error message returned by the shell: |popen| example

<?php >
  error_reporting(E_ALL);
  
  /* Add redirection so we can get stderr. */
  $handle = popen('/path/to/spooge 2>&amp;1', 'r');
  echo "'$handle'; " . gettype($handle) . "\n";
  $read = fread($handle, 2096);
  echo $read;
  pclose($handle);
?>





If you're looking for bi-directional support (two-way), use |proc_open|.

When safe mode is enabled, you can only execute files within the
safe_mode_exec_dir. For practical reasons, it is currently not allowed to have
.. components in the path to the executable.

With safe mode enabled, the command string is escaped with |escapeshellcmd|.
Thus, echo y | echo x becomes echo y \| echo x.

|pclose| |fopen| |proc_open|
