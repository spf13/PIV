mssql_close -- Close MS SQL Server connection

  bool mssql_close([resource link_identifier])~

Closes the link to a MS SQL Server database that's associated with the
specified link identifier. If the link identifier isn't specified, the last
opened link is assumed.

Note that this isn't usually necessary, as non-persistent open links are
automatically closed at the end of the script's execution.

{link_identifier} A MS SQL link identifier, returned by |mssql_connect|.

This function will not close persistent links generated by |mssql_pconnect|.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
