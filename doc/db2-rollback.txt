db2_rollback -- Rolls back a transaction

  bool db2_rollback(resource connection)~

Rolls back an in-progress transaction on the specified connection resource and
begins a new transaction. PHP applications normally default to AUTOCOMMIT
mode, so |db2_rollback| normally has no effect unless AUTOCOMMIT has been
turned off for the connection resource.

If the specified connection resource is a persistent connection, all
transactions in progress for all applications using that persistent connection
will be rolled back. For this reason, persistent connections are not
recommended for use in applications that require transactions.

{connection} A valid database connection resource variable as returned from
|db2_connect| or |db2_pconnect|.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

Rolling back a DELETE statement In the following example, we count the number
of rows in a table, turn off AUTOCOMMIT mode on a database connection, delete
all of the rows in the table and return the count of 0 to prove that the rows
have been removed. We then issue |db2_rollback| and return the updated count
of rows in the table to show that the number is the same as before we issued
the DELETE statement. The return to the original state of the table
demonstrates that the roll back of the transaction succeeded.

<?php >
  $conn = db2_connect($database, $user, $password);
  
  if ($conn) {
      $stmt = db2_exec($conn, "SELECT count(*) FROM animals");
      $res = db2_fetch_array( $stmt );
      echo $res[0] . "\n";
      
      // Turn AUTOCOMMIT off
      db2_autocommit($conn, DB2_AUTOCOMMIT_OFF);
     
      // Delete all rows from ANIMALS
      db2_exec($conn, "DELETE FROM animals");
      
      $stmt = db2_exec($conn, "SELECT count(*) FROM animals");
      $res = db2_fetch_array( $stmt );
      echo $res[0] . "\n";
      
      // Roll back the DELETE statement
      db2_rollback( $conn );
      
      $stmt = db2_exec( $conn, "SELECT count(*) FROM animals" );
      $res = db2_fetch_array( $stmt );
      echo $res[0] . "\n";
      db2_close($conn);
  }
?>

The above example will output:

  7
