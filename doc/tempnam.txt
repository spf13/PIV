tempnam -- Create file with unique file name

  string tempnam(string dir, string prefix)~

Creates a file with a unique filename, with access permission set to 0600, in
the specified directory. If the directory does not exist, |tempnam| may
generate a file in the system's temporary directory, and return the name of
that.

{dir} The directory where the temporary filename will be created.

{prefix} The prefix of the generated temporary filename.

Windows use only the first three characters of prefix.

Returns the new temporary filename, or FALSE on failure.

Version Description 4.0.6 Prior to PHP 4.0.6, the behaviour of the |tempnam|
function was system dependent. On Windows the TMP environment variable will
override the {dir} parameter, on Linux the TMPDIR environment variable has
precedence, while SVR4 will always use your {dir} parameter if the directory
it points to exists. Consult your system documentation on the tempnam(3)
function if in doubt. 4.0.3 This function's behavior changed in 4.0.3. The
temporary file is also created to avoid a race condition where the file might
appear in the filesystem between the time the string was generated and before
the script gets around to creating the file. Note, that you need to remove the
file in case you need it no more, it is not done automatically.

|tempnam| example

<?php >
  $tmpfname = tempnam("/tmp", "FOO");
  
  $handle = fopen($tmpfname, "w");
  fwrite($handle, "writing to tempfile");
  fclose($handle);
  
  // do here something
  
  unlink($tmpfname);
?>





If PHP cannot create a file in the specified {dir} parameter, it falls back on
the system default. On NTFS this also happens if the specified {dir} contains
more than 65534 files.
