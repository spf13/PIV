surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

Return the property for the specified sequence index.

{sequence_index} The position of the element in the sequence.

An SDO_Model_Property. A return value of NULL means the sequence element does
not belong to a property and must therefore be unstructured text.

{SDO_IndexOutOfBoundsException} Thrown if the sequence index is less than zero
or greater than the size of the sequence.
