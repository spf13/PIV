mysql_create_db -- Create a MySQL database

  bool mysql_create_db(string database_name [, resource link_identifier])~

|mysql_create_db| attempts to create a new database on the server associated
with the specified link identifier.

{database_name} The name of the database being created.

{ link_identifier}The MySQL connection. If the link identifier is not
specified, the last link opened by |mysql_connect| is assumed. If no such link
is found, it will try to create one as if |mysql_connect| was called with no
arguments. If by chance no connection is found or established, an E_WARNING
level error is generated.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

|mysql_create_db| alternative example The function |mysql_create_db| is
deprecated. It is preferable to use |mysql_query| to issue a sql CREATE
DATABASE statement instead.

<?php >
  $link = mysql_connect('localhost', 'mysql_user', 'mysql_password');
  if (!$link) {
      die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error());
  }
  
  $sql = 'CREATE DATABASE my_db';
  if (mysql_query($sql, $link)) {
      echo "Database my_db created successfully\n";
  } else {
      echo 'Error creating database: ' . mysql_error() . "\n";
  }
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  Database my_db created successfully



For backward compatibility, the following deprecated alias may be used:
|mysql_createdb|

This function will not be available if the MySQL extension was built against a
MySQL 4.x client library.

|mysql_query| |mysql_select_db|
