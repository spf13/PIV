hw_api->checkin -- Checks in an object

  bool checkin(array parameter)~

This function checks in an object or a whole hierarchy of objects. The
parameters array contains the required element 'objectIdentifier' and the
optional element 'version', 'comment', 'mode' and 'objectQuery'. 'version'
sets the version of the object. It consists of the major and minor version
separated by a period. If the version is not set, the minor version is
incremented. 'mode' can be one of the following values: HW_API_CHECKIN_NORMAL
Checks in and commits the object. The object must be a document.

HW_API_CHECKIN_RECURSIVE If the object to check in is a collection, all
children will be checked in recursively if they are documents. Trying to check
in a collection would result in an error.

HW_API_CHECKIN_FORCE_VERSION_CONTROL Checks in an object even if it is not
under version control.

HW_API_CHECKIN_REVERT_IF_NOT_CHANGED Check if the new version is different
from the last version. Unless this is the case the object will be checked in.

HW_API_CHECKIN_KEEP_TIME_MODIFIED Keeps the time modified from the most recent
object.

HW_API_CHECKIN_NO_AUTO_COMMIT The object is not automatically committed on
check-in.
