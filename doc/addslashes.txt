addslashes -- Quote string with slashes

  string addslashes(string str)~

Returns a string with backslashes before characters that need to be quoted in
database queries etc. These characters are single quote ('), double quote ("),
backslash (\) and NUL (the NULL byte).

An example use of |addslashes| is when you're entering data into a database.
For example, to insert the name O'reilly into a database, you will need to
escape it. It's highly recommeneded to use DBMS specific escape function (e.g.
|mysqli_real_escape_string| for MySQL or |pg_escape_string| for PostgreSQL),
but if the DBMS you're using does't have an escape function and the DBMS uses
\ to escape special chars, you can use this function. This would only be to
get the data into the database, the extra \ will not be inserted. Having the
PHP directive magic_quotes_sybase set to on will mean ' is instead escaped
with another '.

The PHP directive magic_quotes_gpc is on by default, and it essentially runs
|addslashes| on all GET, POST, and COOKIE data. Do not use |addslashes| on
strings that have already been escaped with magic_quotes_gpc as you'll then do
double escaping. The function |get_magic_quotes_gpc| may come in handy for
checking this.

{str} The string to be escaped.

Returns the escaped string.

An |addslashes| example

<?php >
  $str = "Is your name O'reilly?";
  
  // Outputs: Is your name O\'reilly?
  echo addslashes($str);
?>
