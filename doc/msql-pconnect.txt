msql_pconnect -- Open persistent mSQL connection

  resource msql_pconnect([string hostname])~

|msql_pconnect| acts very much like |msql_connect| with two major differences.

First, when connecting, the function would first try to find a (persistent)
link that's already open with the same host. If one is found, an identifier
for it will be returned instead of opening a new connection.

Second, the connection to the SQL server will not be closed when the execution
of the script ends. Instead, the link will remain open for future use
(|msql_close| will not close links established by this function).

{hostname} The hostname can also include a port number. e.g. hostname,port.

If not specified, the connection is established by the means of a Unix domain
socket, being more efficient than a localhost TCP socket connection.

While this function will accept a colon (:) as a host/port separator, a comma
(,) is the preferred method.

Returns a positive mSQL link identifier on success, or FALSE on error.
