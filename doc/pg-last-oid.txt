pg_last_oid -- Returns the last row's OID

  string pg_last_oid(resource result)~

|pg_last_oid| is used to retrieve the OID assigned to an inserted row.

OID field became an optional field from PostgreSQL 7.2 and will not be present
by default in PostgreSQL 8.1. When the OID field is not present in a table,
the programmer must use |pg_result_status| to check for successful insertion.

To get the value of a SERIAL field in an inserted row, it is necessary to use
the PostgreSQL CURRVAL function, naming the sequence whose last value is
required. If the name of the sequence is unknown, the pg_get_serial_sequence
PostgreSQL 8.0 function is necessary.

PostgreSQL 8.1 has a function LASTVAL that returns the value of the most
recently used sequence in the session. This avoids the need for naming the
sequence, table or column altogether.

This function used to be called |pg_getlastoid|.

{result} PostgreSQL query result resource, returned by |pg_query|,
|pg_query_params| or |pg_execute| (among others).

A string containing the OID assigned to the most recently inserted row in the
specified {connection}, or FALSE on error or no available OID.

|pg_last_oid| example

<?php >
    $pgsql_conn = pg_connect("dbname=mark host=localhost");
    
    $res1 = pg_query("CREATE TABLE test (a INTEGER) WITH OIDS");
  
    $res2 = pg_query("INSERT INTO test VALUES (1)");
    
    $oid = pg_last_oid($res2);
?>
