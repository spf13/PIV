gzpassthru -- Output all remaining data on a gz-file pointer

  int gzpassthru(resource zp)~

Reads to EOF on the given gz-file pointer from the current position and writes
the (uncompressed) results to standard output.

You may need to call |gzrewind| to reset the file pointer to the beginning of
the file if you have already written data to it.

If you just want to dump the contents of a file to the output buffer, without
first modifying it or seeking to a particular offset, you may want to use the
|readgzfile| function, which saves you the |gzopen| call.

{zp} The gz-file pointer. It must be valid, and must point to a file
successfully opened by |gzopen|.

The number of uncompressed characters read from {gz} and passed through to the
input, or FALSE on error.

|gzpassthru| example

<?php >
  $fp = gzopen('file.gz', 'r');
  gzpassthru($fp);
  gzclose($fp);
?>
