stripslashes -- Un-quotes a quoted string

  string stripslashes(string str)~

Un-quotes a quoted string.

If magic_quotes_sybase is on, no backslashes are stripped off but two
apostrophes are replaced by one instead.

An example use of |stripslashes| is when the PHP directive magic_quotes_gpc is
on (it's on by default), and you aren't inserting this data into a place (such
as a database) that requires escaping. For example, if you're simply
outputting data straight from an HTML form.

{str} The input string.

Returns a string with backslashes stripped off. (\' becomes ' and so on.)
Double backslashes (\\) are made into a single backslash (\).

A |stripslashes| example

<?php >
  $str = "Is your name O\'reilly?";
  
  // Outputs: Is your name O'reilly?
  echo stripslashes($str);
?>





|stripslashes| is not recursive. If you want to apply this function to a
multi-dimensional array, you need to use a recursive function.

Using |stripslashes| on an array

<?php >
  function stripslashes_deep($value)
  {
      $value = is_array($value) ?
                  array_map('stripslashes_deep', $value) :
                  stripslashes($value);
  
      return $value;
  }
  
  // Example
  $array = array("f\\'oo", "b\\'ar", array("fo\\'o", "b\\'ar"));
  $array = stripslashes_deep($array);
  
  // Output
  print_r($array);
?>

The above example will output:

  Array
  (
      [0] => f'oo
      [1] => b'ar
      [2] => Array
          (
              [0] => fo'o
              [1] => b'ar
          )
  
  )
