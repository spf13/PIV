at an angle of {alpha} and ends at an angle of {beta}. It is drawn clockwise
(use |ps_arc| to draw counterclockwise). The subpath added to the current path
starts on the arc at angle {beta} and ends on the arc at angle {alpha}.

{psdoc} Resource identifier of the postscript file as returned by |ps_new|.

{x} The x-coordinate of the circle's middle point.

{y} The y-coordinate of the circle's middle point.
