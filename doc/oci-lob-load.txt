OCI-Lob->load -- Returns large object's contents

  string load()~

Returns large object's contents. As script execution is terminated when the
memory_limit is reached, ensure that the LOB does not exceed this limit. In
most cases it's recommended to use instead.

Returns the contents of the object, or FALSE on errors.
