db2_conn_error -- Returns a string containing the SQLSTATE returned by the
last connection attempt

  string db2_conn_error([resource connection])~

|db2_conn_error| returns an SQLSTATE value representing the reason the last
attempt to connect to a database failed. As |db2_connect| returns FALSE in the
event of a failed connection attempt, you do not pass any parameters to
|db2_conn_error| to retrieve the SQLSTATE value.

If, however, the connection was successful but becomes invalid over time, you
can pass the {connection} parameter to retrieve the SQLSTATE value for a
specific connection.

To learn what the SQLSTATE value means, you can issue the following command at
a DB2 Command Line Processor prompt: db2 '? {sqlstate-value}'. You can also
call |db2_conn_errormsg| to retrieve an explicit error message and the
associated SQLCODE value.

{connection} A connection resource associated with a connection that initially
succeeded, but which over time became invalid.

Returns the SQLSTATE value resulting from a failed connection attempt. Returns
an empty string if there is no error associated with the last connection
attempt.

Retrieving an SQLSTATE value for a failed connection attempt The following
example demonstrates how to return an SQLSTATE value after deliberately
passing invalid parameters to |db2_connect|.

<?php >
  $conn = db2_connect('badname', 'baduser', 'badpassword');
  if (!$conn) {
      print "SQLSTATE value: " . db2_conn_error();
  }
?>

The above example will output:

  SQLSTATE value: 08001
