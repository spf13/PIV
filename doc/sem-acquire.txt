sem_acquire -- Acquire a semaphore

  bool sem_acquire(resource sem_identifier)~

|sem_acquire| blocks (if necessary) until the semaphore can be acquired. A
process attempting to acquire a semaphore which it has already acquired will
block forever if acquiring the semaphore would cause its maximum number of
semaphore to be exceeded.

After processing a request, any semaphores acquired by the process but not
explicitly released will be released automatically and a warning will be
generated.

{sem_identifier} {sem_identifier} is a semaphore resource, obtained from
|sem_get|.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
