Getting information about fields

<?php >
    $dbconn = pg_connect("dbname=publisher") or die("Could not connect");
  
    $res = pg_query($dbconn, "select * from authors where author = 'Orwell'");
    $i = pg_num_fields($res);
    for ($j = 0; $j < $i; $j++) {
        echo "column $j\n";
        $fieldname = pg_field_name($res, $j);
        echo "fieldname: $fieldname\n";
        echo "printed length: " . pg_field_prtlen($res, $fieldname) . " characters\n";
        echo "storage length: " . pg_field_size($res, $j) . " bytes\n";
        echo "field type: " . pg_field_type($res, $j) . " \n\n";
    }
?>

The above example will output:

  column 0
  fieldname: author
  printed length: 6 characters
  storage length: -1 bytes
  field type: varchar 
  
  column 1
  fieldname: year
  printed length: 4 characters
  storage length: 2 bytes
  field type: int2 
  
  column 2
  fieldname: title
  printed length: 24 characters
  storage length: -1 bytes
  field type: varchar
