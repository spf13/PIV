mt_srand -- Seed the better random number generator

  void mt_srand([int seed])~

Seeds the random number generator with {seed} or with a random value if no
{seed} is given.

As of PHP 4.2.0, there is no need to seed the random number generator with
|srand| or |mt_srand| as this is now done automatically.

{seed} An optional seed value

No value is returned.

Version Description Since 4.2.0 The {seed} becomes optional and defaults to a
random value if omitted. Since 5.2.1 The Mersenne Twister implementation in
PHP now uses a new seeding algorithm by Richard Wagner. Identical seeds no
longer produce the same sequence of values they did in previous versions. This
behavior is not expected to change again, but it is considered unsafe to rely
upon it nonetheless.

|mt_srand| example

<?php >
  // seed with microseconds
  function make_seed()
  {
    list($usec, $sec) = explode(' ', microtime());
    return (float) $sec + ((float) $usec * 100000);
  }
  mt_srand(make_seed());
  $randval = mt_rand();
?>
