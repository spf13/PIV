DomDocument->get_element_by_id -- Searches for an element with a certain id

  domelement DomDocument->get_element_by_id(string id)~

This function is similar to |domdocument_get_elements_by_tagname| but searches
for an element with a given id. According to the DOM standard this requires a
DTD which defines the attribute ID to be of type ID, though the current
implementation simply does an xpath search for "//*[@ID = '%s']". This does
not comply to the DOM standard which requires to return null if it is not
known which attribute is of type id. This behaviour is likely to be fixed, so
do not rely on the current behaviour.
