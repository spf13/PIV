rawurlencode -- URL-encode according to RFC 3986

  string rawurlencode(string str)~

Encodes the given string according to RFC 3986.

{str} The URL to be encoded.

Returns a string in which all non-alphanumeric characters except -_.~ have
been replaced with a percent (%) sign followed by two hex digits. This is the
encoding described in RFC 3986 for protecting literal characters from being
interpreted as special URL delimiters, and for protecting URLs from being
mangled by transmission media with character conversions (like some email
systems). Prior to PHP 5.3.0, rawurlencode encoded tildes (~) as per RFC 1738.

Version Description 5.3.4 Tilde characters are no longer encoded when
|rawurlencode| is used with EBCDIC strings. 5.3.0 Now conforms to RFC 3986.

including a password in an FTP URL

<?php >
  echo '<a href="ftp://user:', rawurlencode('foo @+%/'),
       '@ftp.example.com/x.txt">';
?>

The above example will output:

  <a href="ftp://user:foo%20%40%2B%25%2F@ftp.example.com/x.txt">



Or, if you pass information in a PATH_INFO component of the URL:

|rawurlencode| example 2

<?php >
  echo '<a href="http://example.com/department_list_script/',
      rawurlencode('sales and marketing/Miami'), '">';
?>

The above example will output:

  <a href="http://example.com/department_list_script/sales%20and%20marketing%2FMiami">
