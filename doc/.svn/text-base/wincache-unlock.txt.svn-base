wincache_unlock -- Releases an exclusive lock on a given key

  bool wincache_unlock(string key)~

Releases an exclusive lock that was obtained on a given key by using
|wincache_lock|. If any other process was blocked waiting for the lock on this
key, that process will be able to obtain the lock.

Using of the |wincache_lock| and |wincache_unlock| can cause deadlocks when
executing PHP scripts in a multi-process environment like FastCGI. Do not use
these functions unless you are absolutely sure you need to use them. For the
majority of the operations on the user cache it is not necessary to use these
functions.

{key} Name of the key in the cache to release the lock on.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

Using |wincache_unlock|

<?php >
  $fp = fopen("/tmp/lock.txt", "r+");
  if (wincache_lock(“lock_txt_lock”)) { // do an exclusive lock
      ftruncate($fp, 0); // truncate file
      fwrite($fp, "Write something here\n");
      wincache_unlock(“lock_txt_lock”); // release the lock
  } else {
      echo "Couldn't get the lock!";
  }
  fclose($fp);
?>
