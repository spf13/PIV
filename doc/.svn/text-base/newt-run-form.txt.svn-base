newt_run_form -- Runs a form

  resource newt_run_form(resource form)~

This function runs the form passed to it.

{form} Form component

The component which caused the form to stop running.

Notice that this function doesn't fit in with newt's normal naming convention.
It is an older interface which will not work for all forms. It was left in
newt only for legacy applications. It is a simpler interface than the new
|newt_form_run| though, and is still used quite often as a result. When an
application is done with a form, it destroys the form and all of the
components the form contains.

|newt_form_run| |newt_form_destroy|
