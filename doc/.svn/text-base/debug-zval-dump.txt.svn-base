debug_zval_dump -- Dumps a string representation of an internal zend value to
output

  void debug_zval_dump(mixed variable)~

Dumps a string representation of an internal zend value to output.

{variable} The variable being evaluated.

No value is returned.

|debug_zval_dump| example

<?php >
  $var1 = 'Hello World';
  $var2 = '';
  
  $var2 =&amp; $var1;
  
  debug_zval_dump(&amp;$var1);
?>

The above example will output:

  &amp;string(11) "Hello World" refcount(3)



The refcount value returned by this function is non-obvious in certain
circumstances. For example, a developer might expect the above example to
indicate a refcount of 2. The third reference is created when actually calling
|debug_zval_dump|.

This behavior is further compounded when a variable is not passed to
|debug_zval_dump| by reference. To illustrate, consider a slightly modified
version of the above example:

<?php >
  $var1 = 'Hello World';
  $var2 = '';
  
  $var2 =&amp; $var1;
  
  debug_zval_dump($var1); // not passed by reference, this time
?>

The above example will output:

  string(11) "Hello World" refcount(1)



Why refcount(1)? Because a copy of $var1 is being made, when the function is
called.

This function becomes even more confusing when a variable with a refcount of 1
is passed (by copy/value):

<?php >
  $var1 = 'Hello World';
  
  debug_zval_dump($var1);
?>

The above example will output:

  string(11) "Hello World" refcount(2)



A refcount of 2, here, is extremely non-obvious. Especially considering the
above examples. So what's happening?

When a variable has a single reference (as did $var1 before it was used as an
argument to |debug_zval_dump|), PHP's engine optimizes the manner in which it
is passed to a function. Internally, PHP treats $var1 like a reference (in
that the refcount is increased for the scope of this function), with the
caveat that if the passed reference happens to be written to, a copy is made,
but only at the moment of writing. This is known as "copy on write."

So, if |debug_zval_dump| happened to write to its sole parameter (and it
doesn't), then a copy would be made. Until then, the parameter remains a
reference, causing the refcount to be incremented to 2 for the scope of the
function call.
