is_callable -- Verify that the contents of a variable can be called as a
function

  bool is_callable(callback name [, bool syntax_only [, string callable_name]])~

Verify that the contents of a variable can be called as a function. This can
check that a simple variable contains the name of a valid function, or that an
array contains a properly encoded object and function name.

{name} Can be either the name of a function stored in a string variable, or an
object and the name of a method within the object, like this:

  array($SomeObject, 'MethodName')



{syntax_only} If set to TRUE the function only verifies that {name} might be a
function or method. It will only reject simple variables that are not strings,
or an array that does not have a valid structure to be used as a callback. The
valid ones are supposed to have only 2 entries, the first of which is an
object or a string, and the second a string.

{callable_name} Receives the "callable name". In the example below it is
"someClass::someMethod". Note, however, that despite the implication that
someClass::SomeMethod() is a callable static method, this is not the case.

Returns TRUE if {name} is callable, FALSE otherwise.
