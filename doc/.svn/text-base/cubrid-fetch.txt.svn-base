cubrid_fetch -- Fetch the next row from a result set

  mixed cubrid_fetch(resource result [, int type])~

The |cubrid_fetch| function is used to get a single row from the query result.
The cursor automatically moves to the next row after getting the result.

{result} {result} comes from a call to |cubrid_execute|

{type} Array type of the fetched result CUBRID_NUM, CUBRID_ASSOC, CUBRID_BOTH,
CUBRID_OBJECT.

Result array or object, when process is successful.

FALSE, when process is unsuccessful.

The result can be received either as an array or as an object, and you can
decide which data type to use by setting the {type} argument. The {type}
variable can be set to one of the following values:

When {type} argument is omitted, the result will be received using CUBRID_BOTH
option as default. When you want to receive query result in object data type,
the column name of the result must obey the naming rules for identifiers in
PHP. For example, column name such as "count(*)" cannot be received in object
type.

|cubrid_fetch| example

<?php >
  $conn = cubrid_connect("localhost", 33088, "demodb");
  $req = cubrid_execute($conn, "SELECT * FROM stadium WHERE nation_code='GRE' AND seats > 10000");
  
  printf("%-40s %-10s %-6s %-20s\n", "name", "area", "seats", "address");
  while ($row = cubrid_fetch($req)) {
      printf("%-40s %-10s %-6s %-20s\n", 
          $row["name"], $row["area"], $row["seats"], $row["address"]);
  }
  
  cubrid_close_request($req);
  
  cubrid_disconnect($conn);
?>

The above example will output:
