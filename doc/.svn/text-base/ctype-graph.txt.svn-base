<?php >
  $strings = array('string1' => "asdf\n\r\t", 'string2' => 'arf12', 'string3' => 'LKA#@%.54');
  foreach ($strings as $name => $testcase) {
      if (ctype_graph($testcase)) {
          echo "The string '$name' consists of all (visibly) printable characters.\n";
      } else {
          echo "The string '$name' does not consist of all (visibly) printable characters.\n";
      }
