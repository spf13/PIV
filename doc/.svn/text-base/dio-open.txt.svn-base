dio_open -- Opens a file (creating it if necessary) at a lower level than the
C library input/ouput stream functions allow.

  resource dio_open(string filename, int flags [, int mode])~

|dio_open| opens a file and returns a new file descriptor for it.

{filename} The pathname of the file to open.

{flags} The {flags} parameter is a bitwise-ORed value comprising flags from
the following list. This value must include one of O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, or
O_RDWR. Additionally, it may include any combination of the other flags from
this list. O_RDONLY - opens the file for read access.

O_WRONLY - opens the file for write access.

O_RDWR - opens the file for both reading and writing.

O_CREAT - creates the file, if it doesn't already exist.

O_EXCL - if both O_CREAT and O_EXCL are set and the file already exists,
causes |dio_open| to fail.

O_TRUNC - if the file exists and is opened for write access, the file will be
truncated to zero length.

O_APPEND - write operations write data at the end of the file.

O_NONBLOCK - sets non blocking mode.

O_NOCTTY - prevent the OS from assigning the opened file as the process's
controlling terminal when opening a TTY device file.

{mode} If {flags} contains O_CREAT, {mode} will set the permissions of the
file (creation permissions). {Mode} is required for correct operation when
O_CREAT is specified in mode and is ignored otherwise.

The actual permissions assigned to the created file will be affected by the
process's umask setting as per usual.

A file descriptor or FALSE on error.
