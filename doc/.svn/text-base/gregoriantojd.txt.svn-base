GregorianToJD -- Converts a Gregorian date to Julian Day Count

  int gregoriantojd(int month, int day, int year)~

Valid Range for Gregorian Calendar 4714 B.C. to 9999 A.D.

Although this function can handle dates all the way back to 4714 B.C., such
use may not be meaningful. The Gregorian calendar was not instituted until
October 15, 1582 (or October 5, 1582 in the Julian calendar). Some countries
did not accept it until much later. For example, Britain converted in 1752,
The USSR in 1918 and Greece in 1923. Most European countries used the Julian
calendar prior to the Gregorian.

{month} The month as a number from 1 (for January) to 12 (for December)

{day} The day as a number from 1 to 31

{year} The year as a number between -4714 and 9999

The julian day for the given gregorian date as an integer.
