event_add -- Add an event to the set of monitored events

  bool event_add(resource event [, int timeout])~

|event_add| schedules the execution of the {event} when the event specified in
|event_set| occurs or in at least the time specified by the {timeout}
argument. If {timeout} was not specified, not timeout is set. The {event} must
be already initalized by |event_set| and |event_base_set| functions. If the
{event} already has a timeout set, it is replaced by the new one.

{event} Valid event resource.

{timeout} Optional timeout (in microseconds).

|event_add| returns TRUE on success or FALSE on error.
