db2_connect -- Returns a connection to a database

  resource db2_connect(string database, string username, string password [, array options])~

Creates a new connection to an IBM DB2 Universal Database, IBM Cloudscape, or
Apache Derby database.

{database} For a cataloged connection to a database, {database} represents the
database alias in the DB2 client catalog.

For an uncataloged connection to a database, {database} represents a complete
connection string in the following format:

  DATABASE=



  database



  ;HOSTNAME=



  hostname



  ;PORT=



  port



  ;PROTOCOL=TCPIP;UID=



  username



  ;PWD=



  password



  ;

where the parameters represent the following values: {database} The name of
the database.

{hostname} The hostname or IP address of the database server.

{port} The TCP/IP port on which the database is listening for requests.

{username} The username with which you are connecting to the database.

{password} The password with which you are connecting to the database.

{username} The username with which you are connecting to the database.

For uncataloged connections, you must pass a NULL value or empty string.

{password} The password with which you are connecting to the database.

For uncataloged connections, you must pass a NULL value or empty string.

{options} An associative array of connection options that affect the behavior
of the connection, where valid array keys include: {autocommit} Passing the
DB2_AUTOCOMMIT_ON value turns autocommit on for this connection handle.

Passing the DB2_AUTOCOMMIT_OFF value turns autocommit off for this connection
handle.

{DB2_ATTR_CASE} Passing the DB2_CASE_NATURAL value specifies that column names
are returned in natural case.

Passing the DB2_CASE_LOWER value specifies that column names are returned in
lower case.

Passing the DB2_CASE_UPPER value specifies that column names are returned in
upper case.

{CURSOR} Passing the DB2_FORWARD_ONLY value specifies a forward-only cursor
for a statement resource. This is the default cursor type and is supported on
all database servers.

Passing the DB2_SCROLLABLE value specifies a scrollable cursor for a statement
resource. This mode enables random access to rows in a result set, but
currently is supported only by IBM DB2 Universal Database.

The following new option is available in ibm_db2 version 1.7.0 and later.
{trustedcontext} Passing the DB2_TRUSTED_CONTEXT_ENABLE value turns trusted
context on for this connection handle. This parameter cannot be set using
|db2_set_option|.

This key works only if the database is cataloged (even if the database is
local), or if you specify the full DSN when you create the connection.

To catalog the database, use following commands:

  db2 catalog tcpip node loopback remote

  server

  db2 catalog database

  as

  at node loopback
  db2 "update dbm cfg using svcename
