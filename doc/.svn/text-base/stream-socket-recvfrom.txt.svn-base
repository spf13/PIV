stream_socket_recvfrom -- Receives data from a socket, connected or not

  string stream_socket_recvfrom(resource socket, int length [, int flags [, string address]])~

|stream_socket_recvfrom| accepts data from a remote socket up to {length}
bytes.

{socket} The remote socket.

{length} The number of bytes to receive from the {socket}.

{flags} The value of {flags} can be any combination of the following: Possible
values for {flags} STREAM_OOB Process OOB (out-of-band) data. STREAM_PEEK
Retrieve data from the socket, but do not consume the buffer. Subsequent calls
to |fread| or |stream_socket_recvfrom| will see the same data.

{address} If {address} is provided it will be populated with the address of
the remote socket.

Returns the read data, as a string

|stream_socket_recvfrom| example

<?php >
  /* Open a server socket to port 1234 on localhost */
  $server = stream_socket_server('tcp://127.0.0.1:1234');
  
  /* Accept a connection */
  $socket = stream_socket_accept($server);
  
  /* Grab a packet (1500 is a typical MTU size) of OOB data */
  echo "Received Out-Of-Band: '" . stream_socket_recvfrom($socket, 1500, STREAM_OOB) . "'\n";
  
  /* Take a peek at the normal in-band data, but don't comsume it. */
  echo "Data: '" . stream_socket_recvfrom($socket, 1500, STREAM_PEEK) . "'\n";
  
  /* Get the exact same packet again, but remove it from the buffer this time. */
  echo "Data: '" . stream_socket_recvfrom($socket, 1500) . "'\n";
  
  /* Close it up */
  fclose($socket);
  fclose($server);
?>





If a message received is longer than the {length} parameter, excess bytes may
be discarded depending on the type of socket the message is received from
(such as UDP).

Calls to |stream_socket_recvfrom| on socket-based streams, after calls to
buffer-based stream functions (like |fread| or |stream_get_line|) read data
directly from the socket and bypass the stream buffer.
