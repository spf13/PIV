apd_set_session_trace -- Starts the session debugging

  void apd_set_session_trace(int debug_level [, string dump_directory])~

Starts debugging to apd_dump_{process_id} in the dump directory.

{ debug_level}An integer which is formed by adding together the XXX_TRACE
constants.

It is not recommended to use MEMORY_TRACE. It is very slow and does not appear
to be accurate. ASSIGNMENT_TRACE is not implemented yet.

To turn on all functional traces (TIMING, FUNCTIONS, ARGS SUMMARY (like strace
-c)) use the value 99

{dump_directory} The directory in which the profile dump file is written. If
not set, the apd.dumpdir setting from the php.ini file is used.

No value is returned.
