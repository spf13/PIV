session_write_close -- Write session data and end session

  void session_write_close()~

End the current session and store session data.

Session data is usually stored after your script terminated without the need
to call |session_write_close|, but as session data is locked to prevent
concurrent writes only one script may operate on a session at any time. When
using framesets together with sessions you will experience the frames loading
one by one due to this locking. You can reduce the time needed to load all the
frames by ending the session as soon as all changes to session variables are
done.

No value is returned.
