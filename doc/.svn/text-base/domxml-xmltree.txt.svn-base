domxml_xmltree -- Creates a tree of PHP objects from an XML document

  DomDocument domxml_xmltree(string str)~

The function parses the XML document in {str} and returns a tree PHP objects
as the parsed document.

This function is isolated from the other functions, which means you cannot
access the tree with any of the other functions. Modifying it, for example by
adding nodes, makes no sense since there is currently no way to dump it as an
XML file.

However this function may be valuable if you want to read a file and
investigate the content.

{str} The contents of the XML file.

Returns a tree of Dom objects starting by a DomDocument.
