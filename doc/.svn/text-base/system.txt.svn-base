system -- Execute an external program and display the output

  string system(string command [, int return_var])~

|system| is just like the C version of the function in that it executes the
given {command} and outputs the result.

The |system| call also tries to automatically flush the web server's output
buffer after each line of output if PHP is running as a server module.

If you need to execute a command and have all the data from the command passed
directly back without any interference, use the |passthru| function.

{command} The command that will be executed.

{return_var} If the {return_var} argument is present, then the return status
of the executed command will be written to this variable.

Returns the last line of the command output on success, and FALSE on failure.

|system| example

<?php >
  echo '<pre>';
  
  // Outputs all the result of shellcommand "ls", and returns
  // the last output line into $last_line. Stores the return value
  // of the shell command in $retval.
  $last_line = system('ls', $retval);
  
  // Printing additional info
  echo '
  </pre>
  <hr />Last line of the output: ' . $last_line . '
  <hr />Return value: ' . $retval;
?>





When allowing user-supplied data to be passed to this function, use
|escapeshellarg| or |escapeshellcmd| to ensure that users cannot trick the
system into executing arbitrary commands.

If a program is started with this function, in order for it to continue
running in the background, the output of the program must be redirected to a
file or another output stream. Failing to do so will cause PHP to hang until
the execution of the program ends.

When safe mode is enabled, you can only execute files within the
safe_mode_exec_dir. For practical reasons, it is currently not allowed to have
.. components in the path to the executable.

With safe mode enabled, the command string is escaped with |escapeshellcmd|.
Thus, echo y | echo x becomes echo y \| echo x.
