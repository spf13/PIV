oci_set_client_identifier -- Sets the client identifier

  bool oci_set_client_identifier(resource connection, string client_identifier)~

Sets the client identifier used by various database components to identify
lightweight application users who authenticate as the same database user.

The client identifier is registered with the database when the next
'roundtrip' from PHP to the database occurs, typically when an SQL statement
is executed.

The identifier can subsequently be queried from database administration views
such as V$SESSION. It can be used with DBMS_MONITOR.CLIENT_ID_TRACE_ENABLE for
tracing. It can be used for auditing.

The value may be retained across persistent connections.

{connection} An Oracle connection identifier, returned by |oci_connect|,
|oci_pconnect|, or |oci_new_connect|.

{client_identifier} User chosen string up to 64 bytes long.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

Setting the client identifier to the application user

<?php >
  // Find the application user's login name
  session_start();
  $un = my_validate_session($_SESSION['username']);
  $c = oci_connect('myschema', 'welcome', 'localhost/XE');
  
  // Tell Oracle who that user is
  oci_set_client_identifier($c, $un);
  
  // The next roundtrip to the database will piggyback the identifier
  $s = oci_parse($c, 'select mydata from mytable');
  oci_execute($s);
  
  // ...
?>





Some but not all OCI8 functions cause roundtrips. Roundtrips to the database
may not occur with queries when result caching is enabled.
