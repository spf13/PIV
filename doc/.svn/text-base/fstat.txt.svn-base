fstat -- Gets information about a file using an open file pointer

  array fstat(resource handle)~

Gathers the statistics of the file opened by the file pointer {handle}. This
function is similar to the |stat| function except that it operates on an open
file pointer instead of a filename.

{handle} A file system pointer resource that is typically created using
|fopen|.

Returns an array with the statistics of the file; the format of the array is
described in detail on the |stat| manual page.

|fstat| example

<?php >
  // open a file
  $fp = fopen("/etc/passwd", "r");
  
  // gather statistics
  $fstat = fstat($fp);
  
  // close the file
  fclose($fp);
  
  // print only the associative part
  print_r(array_slice($fstat, 13));
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  Array
  (
      [dev] => 771
      [ino] => 488704
      [mode] => 33188
      [nlink] => 1
      [uid] => 0
      [gid] => 0
      [rdev] => 0
      [size] => 1114
      [atime] => 1061067181
      [mtime] => 1056136526
      [ctime] => 1056136526
      [blksize] => 4096
      [blocks] => 8
  )



This function will not work on remote files as the file to be examined must be
accessible via the server"s filesystem.
