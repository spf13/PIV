Converts a date from the French Republican Calendar to a Julian Day Count.

These routines only convert dates in years 1 through 14 (Gregorian dates 22
September 1792 through 22 September 1806). This more than covers the period
when the calendar was in use.

{month} The month as a number from 1 (for Vendémiaire) to 13 (for the period
of 5-6 days at the end of each year)

{day} The day as a number from 1 to 30

{year} The year as a number between 1 and 14

The julian day for the given french revolution date as an integer.
