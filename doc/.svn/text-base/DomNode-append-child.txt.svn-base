DomNode->append_child -- Adds a new child at the end of the children

  DOMNode append_child(DOMNode newnode)~

This functions appends a child to an existing list of children or creates a
new list of children.

{newnode} The node being appended. It can be created with e.g. , etc. or
simply by using any other node.

You can not append a DOMAttribute using this method. Use instead.

Returns the appended node on success or FALSE on failure.

Version Description 4.3.0 You are not allowed anymore to insert a node from
another document. 4.3.0 Prior to PHP 4.3.0, the new child is duplicated before
being appended. Therefore the new child is a completely new copy which can be
modified without changing the node which was passed to this function. If the
node passed has children itself, they will be duplicated as well, which makes
it quite easy to duplicate large parts of an XML document. The return value is
the appended child. If you plan to do further modifications on the appended
child you must use the returned node. 4.3.0 and 4.3.1 The new child {newnode}
is first unlinked from its existing context, if it's already a child of
DomNode. Therefore the {newnode} is moved and not copies anymore. This is the
behaviour according to the W3C specifications. If you need the old behaviour,
use before appending. 4.3.2 The new child {newnode} is first unlinked from its
existing context, if it's already in the tree. Same rules apply.

The following example adds a new element node to a fresh document and sets the
attribute align to left.

Adding a child

<?php >
  $doc = domxml_new_doc("1.0");
  $node = $doc->create_element("para");
  $newnode = $doc->append_child($node);
  $newnode->set_attribute("align", "left");
?>





The above example could also be written as the following:

Adding a child

<?php >
  $doc = domxml_new_doc("1.0");
  $node = $doc->create_element("para");
  $node->set_attribute("align", "left");
  $newnode = $doc->append_child($node);
?>





A more complex example is the one below. It first searches for a certain
element, duplicates it including its children and adds it as a sibling.
Finally a new attribute is added to one of the children of the new sibling and
the whole document is dumped.

Adding a child

<?php >
  include("example.inc");
  
  if (!$dom = domxml_open_mem($xmlstr)) {
    echo "Error while parsing the document\n";
    exit;
  }
  
  $elements = $dom->get_elements_by_tagname("informaltable");
  print_r($elements);
  $element = $elements[0];
  
  $parent = $element->parent_node();
  $newnode = $parent->append_child($element);
  $children = $newnode->children();
  $attr = $children[1]->set_attribute("align", "left");
  
  $xmlfile = $dom->dump_mem();
  echo htmlentities($xmlfile);
?>





The above example could also be done with instead of .
