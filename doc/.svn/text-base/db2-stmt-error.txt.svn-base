db2_stmt_error -- Returns a string containing the SQLSTATE returned by an SQL
statement

  string db2_stmt_error([resource stmt])~

Returns a string containing the SQLSTATE value returned by an SQL statement.

If you do not pass a statement resource as an argument to |db2_stmt_error|,
the driver returns the SQLSTATE value associated with the last attempt to
return a statement resource, for example, from |db2_prepare| or |db2_exec|.

To learn what the SQLSTATE value means, you can issue the following command at
a DB2 Command Line Processor prompt: db2 '? {sqlstate-value}'. You can also
call |db2_stmt_errormsg| to retrieve an explicit error message and the
associated SQLCODE value.

{stmt} A valid statement resource.

Returns a string containing an SQLSTATE value.
