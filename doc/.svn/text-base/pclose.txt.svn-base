pclose -- Closes process file pointer

  int pclose(resource handle)~

Closes a file pointer to a pipe opened by |popen|.

{handle} The file pointer must be valid, and must have been returned by a
successful call to |popen|.

Returns the termination status of the process that was run. In case of an
error then -1 is returned.

|pclose| example

<?php >
  $handle = popen('/bin/ls', 'r');
  pclose($handle);
?>





|proc_close| is internally implemented using the waitpid(3) system call. To
obtain the real exit status code the |pcntl_wexitstatus| function should be
used.
