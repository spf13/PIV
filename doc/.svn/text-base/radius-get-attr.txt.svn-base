radius_get_attr -- Extracts an attribute

  mixed radius_get_attr(resource radius_handle)~

Like Radius requests, each response may contain zero or more attributes. After
a response has been received successfully by |radius_send_request|, its
attributes can be extracted one by one using |radius_get_attr|. Each time
|radius_get_attr| is called, it gets the next attribute from the current
response.
