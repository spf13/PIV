odbc_prepare -- Prepares a statement for execution

  resource odbc_prepare(resource connection_id, string query_string)~

Prepares a statement for execution. The result identifier can be used later to
execute the statement with |odbc_execute|.

Some databases (such as IBM DB2, MS SQL Server, and Oracle) support stored
procedures that accept parameters of type IN, INOUT, and OUT as defined by the
ODBC specification. However, the Unified ODBC driver currently only supports
parameters of type IN to stored procedures.

{connection_id} The ODBC connection identifier, see |odbc_connect| for
details.

{query_string} The query string statement being prepared.

Returns an ODBC result identifier if the SQL command was prepared
successfully. Returns FALSE on error.

|odbc_execute| and |odbc_prepare| example In the following code, $success will
only be TRUE if all three parameters to myproc are IN parameters:

<?php >
  $a = 1;
  $b = 2;
  $c = 3;
  $stmt    = odbc_prepare($conn, 'CALL myproc(?,?,?)');
  $success = odbc_execute($stmt, array($a, $b, $c));
?>



If you need to call a stored procedure using INOUT or OUT parameters, the
recommended workaround is to use a native extension for your database (for
example, mssql for MS SQL Server, or oci8 for Oracle).
