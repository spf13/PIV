SCA_SoapProxy::createDataObject -- create an SDO

  SDO_DataObject SCA_SoapProxy::createDataObject(string type_namespace_uri, string type_name)~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

This method is used inside either an ordinary PHP script or an SCA component
that needs to create an SDO to pass to a web service. The parameters are the
desired SDO's namespace URI and type name. The namespace and type must be
defined in the interface of the component that is to be called, so the
namespace and type must be defined within the WSDL for the web service. If the
web service is also an SCA component then the types will have been defined
within one of the schema files which are specified on the @types annotation
within the component for which the SCA_SoapProxy object is a proxy.

{type_namespace_uri} The namespace of the type.

{type_name} The name of the type.

Returns the newly created SDO_DataObject.

{SDO_TypeNotFoundException} Thrown if the namespaceURI and typeName do not
correspond to a type found in the WSDL that was used to initialise this
SCA_SoapProxy.
