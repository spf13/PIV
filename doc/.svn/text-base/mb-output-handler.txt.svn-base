mb_output_handler -- Callback function converts character encoding in output
buffer

  string mb_output_handler(string contents, int status)~

|mb_output_handler| is |ob_start| callback function. |mb_output_handler|
converts characters in the output buffer from internal character encoding to
HTTP output character encoding.

{contents} The contents of the output buffer.

{status} The status of the output buffer.

The converted string.

Version Description 4.1.0 This handler now adds the charset HTTP header when
the following conditions are met:

Does not set Content-Type, using |header|.

The default MIME type begins with text/.

The mbstring.http_input setting is something other than pass.

|mb_output_handler| example

<?php >
  mb_http_output("UTF-8");
  ob_start("mb_output_handler");
?>





If you want to output some binary data such as image from PHP script with PHP
4.3.0 or later, Content-Type: header must be send using |header| before any
binary data was send to client (e.g. header("Content-Type: image/png")). If
Content-Type: header was send, output character encoding conversion will not
be performed.

Note that if 'Content-Type: text/*' was send using |header|, the sending data
is regarded as text, encoding conversion will be performed using character
encoding settings.

If you want to output some binary data such as image from PHP script with PHP
4.2.x or earlier, you must set output encoding to "pass" using
|mb_http_output|.
