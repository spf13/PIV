  bool fbsql_autocommit(resource link_identifier [, bool OnOff])~

{ link_identifier}A FrontBase link identifier returned by |fbsql_connect| or
|fbsql_pconnect|.

the FrontBase server and if no such link is found it will try to create one as
if |fbsql_connect| was called with no arguments.

{OnOff} If this optional parameter is given the auto commit status will be
changed.

With {OnOff} set to TRUE each statement will be committed automatically, if no
errors was found.

With OnOff set to FALSE the user must commit or rollback the transaction using
either |fbsql_commit| or |fbsql_rollback|.

Returns the current autocommit status, as a boolean.
