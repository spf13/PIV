wincache_ocache_fileinfo -- Retrieves information about files cached in the
opcode cache

  array wincache_ocache_fileinfo([bool summaryonly])~

Retrieves information about opcode cache content and its usage.

{summaryonly} Controls whether the returned array will contain information
about individual cache entries along with the opcode cache summary.

Array of meta data about opcode cache or FALSE on failure

The array returned by this function contains the following elements:
total_cache_uptime - total time in seconds that the opcode cache has been
active

total_file_count - total number of files that are currently in the opcode
cache

total_hit_count - number of times the compiled opcode have been served from
the cache

total_miss_count - number of times the compiled opcode have not been found in
the cache

is_local_cache - true is the cache metadata is for a local cache instance,
false if the metadata is for the global cache

file_entries - an array that contains the information about all the cached
files: file_name - absolute file name of the cached file

add_time - time in seconds since the file has been added to the opcode cache

use_time - time in seconds since the file has been accessed in the opcode
cache

last_check - time in seconds since the file has been checked for modifications

hit_count - number of times the file has been served from the cache

function_count - number of functions in the cached file

class_count - number of classes in the cached file

A |wincache_ocache_fileinfo| example

  <pre>
<?php >
  print_r(wincache_ocache_fileinfo());
?>
  </pre>

The above example will output:

      [total_hit_count] => 36562
      [total_miss_count] => 201
      [file_entries] => Array
