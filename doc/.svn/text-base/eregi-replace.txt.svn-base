eregi_replace -- Replace regular expression case insensitive

  string eregi_replace(string pattern, string replacement, string string)~

This function is identical to |ereg_replace| except that this ignores case
distinction when matching alphabetic characters.

This function has been DEPRECATED as of PHP 5.3.0. Relying on this feature is
highly discouraged.

{pattern} A POSIX extended regular expression.

{replacement} If {pattern} contains parenthesized substrings, {replacement}
may contain substrings of the form \\digit, which will be replaced by the text
matching the digit'th parenthesized substring; \\0 will produce the entire
contents of string. Up to nine substrings may be used. Parentheses may be
nested, in which case they are counted by the opening parenthesis.

{string} The input string.

The modified string is returned. If no matches are found in {string}, then it
will be returned unchanged.

Highlight search results

<?php >
  $pattern = '(>[^<]*)('. quotemeta($_GET['search']) .')';
  $replacement = '\\1<span class="search">\\2</span>';
  $body = eregi_replace($pattern, $replacement, $body);
?>





As of PHP 5.3.0, the regex extension is deprecated in favor of the PCRE
extension. Calling this function will issue an E_DEPRECATED notice. See the
list of differences for help on converting to PCRE.
