ncurses_nocbreak -- Switch terminal to cooked mode

  bool ncurses_nocbreak()~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

Returns terminal to normal (cooked) mode. Initially the terminal may or may
not in cbreak mode as the mode is inherited. Therefore a program should call
|ncurses_cbreak| and |ncurses_nocbreak| explicitly.

Returns TRUE if any error occurred, otherwise FALSE.
