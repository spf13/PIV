array_uintersect_assoc -- Computes the intersection of arrays with additional
index check, compares data by a callback function

  array array_uintersect_assoc(array array1, array array2 [, array ..., callback data_compare_func])~

Computes the intersection of arrays with additional index check, compares data
by a callback function.

Note that the keys are used in the comparison unlike in |array_uintersect|.
The data is compared by using a callback function.

{array1} The first array.

{array2} The second array.

{data_compare_func} For comparison is used the user supplied callback
function. It must return an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero
if the first argument is considered to be respectively less than, equal to, or
greater than the second.

Returns an array containing all the values of {array1} that are present in all
the arguments.

|array_uintersect_assoc| example

<?php >
  $array1 = array("a" => "green", "b" => "brown", "c" => "blue", "red");
  $array2 = array("a" => "GREEN", "B" => "brown", "yellow", "red");
  
  print_r(array_uintersect_assoc($array1, $array2, "strcasecmp"));
?>

The above example will output:

  Array
  (
      [a] => green
  )
