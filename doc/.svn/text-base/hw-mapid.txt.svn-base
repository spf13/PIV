hw_mapid -- Maps global id on virtual local id

  int hw_mapid(int connection, int server_id, int object_id)~

Maps a global object id on any hyperwave server, even those you did not
connect to with |hw_connect|, onto a virtual object id.

This virtual object id can then be used as any other object id, e.g. to obtain
the object record with |hw_getobject|.

Note: In order to use this function you will have to set the F_DISTRIBUTED
flag, which can currently only be set at compile time in hg_comm.c. It is not
set by default. Read the comment at the beginning of hg_comm.c

{connection} The connection identifier.

{server_id} The server id is the first part of the global object id (GOid) of
the object which is actually the IP number as an integer.

{object_id} The object identifier.

Returns the virtual object id.
