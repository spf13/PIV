JulianToJD -- Converts a Julian Calendar date to Julian Day Count

  int juliantojd(int month, int day, int year)~

Valid Range for Julian Calendar 4713 B.C. to 9999 A.D.

Although this function can handle dates all the way back to 4713 B.C., such
use may not be meaningful. The calendar was created in 46 B.C., but the
details did not stabilize until at least 8 A.D., and perhaps as late at the
4th century. Also, the beginning of a year varied from one culture to another
- not all accepted January as the first month.

Remember, the current calendar system being used worldwide is the Gregorian
calendar. |gregoriantojd| can be used to convert such dates to their Julian
Day count.

{month} The month as a number from 1 (for January) to 12 (for December)

{day} The day as a number from 1 to 31

{year} The year as a number between -4713 and 9999

The julian day for the given julian date as an integer.
