|imap_delete| example

<?php >
  $mbox = imap_open("{imap.example.org}INBOX", "username", "password")
      or die("Can't connect: " . imap_last_error());
  
  $check = imap_mailboxmsginfo($mbox);
  echo "Messages before delete: " . $check->Nmsgs . "<br />\n";
  
  imap_delete($mbox, 1);
  
  $check = imap_mailboxmsginfo($mbox);
  echo "Messages after  delete: " . $check->Nmsgs . "<br />\n";
  
  imap_expunge($mbox);
  
  $check = imap_mailboxmsginfo($mbox);
  echo "Messages after expunge: " . $check->Nmsgs . "<br />\n";
  
  imap_close($mbox);
?>





POP3 mailboxes do not have their message flags saved between connections, so
|imap_expunge| must be called during the same connection in order for messages
marked for deletion to actually be purged.
