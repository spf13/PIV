hw_api->find -- Search for objects

  array find(array parameter)~

This functions searches for objects either by executing a key or/and full text
query. The found objects can further be filtered by an optional object query.
They are sorted by their importance. The second search operation is relatively
slow and its result can be limited to a certain number of hits. This allows to
perform an incremental search, each returning just a subset of all found
documents, starting at a given index.

{parameter} The parameter array contains the 'keyquery' or/and 'fulltextquery'
depending on who you would like to search. Optional parameters are
'objectquery', 'scope', 'languages' and 'attributeselector'. In case of an
incremental search the optional parameters 'startIndex',
'numberOfObjectsToGet' and 'exactMatchUnit' can be passed.
