dbase_open -- Opens a database

  int dbase_open(string filename, int mode)~

|dbase_open| opens a dBase database with the given access mode.

When safe mode is enabled, PHP checks whether the files or directories being
operated upon have the same UID (owner) as the script that is being executed.

This function is affected by open_basedir.

{filename} The name of the database. It can be a relative or absolute path to
the file where dBase will store your data.

{mode} An integer which correspond to those for the open() system call
(Typically 0 means read-only, 1 means write-only, and 2 means read and write).

You can't open a dBase file in write-only mode as the function will fail to
read the headers information and thus you can't use 1 as {mode}.

Opening a dBase database file

<?php >
  // open in read-only mode
  $db = dbase_open('/tmp/test.dbf', 0);
  
  if ($db) {
    // read some data ..
    
    dbase_close($db);
  }
?>





Returns a database link identifier if the database is successfully opened, or
FALSE if an error occurred.

|dbase_create| |dbase_close|
