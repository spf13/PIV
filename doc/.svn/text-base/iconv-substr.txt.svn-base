iconv_substr -- Cut out part of a string

  string iconv_substr(string str, int offset [, int length [, string charset]])~

Cuts a portion of {str} specified by the {offset} and {length} parameters.

{str} The original string.

{offset} If {offset} is non-negative, |iconv_substr| cuts the portion out of
{str} beginning at {offset}'th character, counting from zero.

If {offset} is negative, |iconv_substr| cuts out the portion beginning at the
position, {offset} characters away from the end of {str}.

{length} If {length} is given and is positive, the return value will contain
at most {length} characters of the portion that begins at {offset} (depending
on the length of {string}).

If negative {length} is passed, |iconv_substr| cuts the portion out of {str}
from the {offset}'th character up to the character that is {length} characters
away from the end of the string. In case {offset} is also negative, the start
position is calculated beforehand according to the rule explained above.

{charset} If {charset} parameter is omitted, {string} are assumed to be
encoded in iconv.internal_encoding.

Note that {offset} and {length} parameters are always deemed to represent
offsets that are calculated on the basis of the character set determined by
{charset}, whilst the counterpart |substr| always takes these for byte
offsets.

Returns the portion of {str} specified by the {offset} and {length}
parameters.

If {str} is shorter than {offset} characters long, FALSE will be returned.
