fbsql_fetch_object -- Fetch a result row as an object

  object fbsql_fetch_object(resource result)~

|fbsql_fetch_object| is similar to |fbsql_fetch_array|, with one difference -
an object is returned, instead of an array. Indirectly, that means that you
can only access the data by the field names, and not by their offsets (numbers
are illegal property names).

Speed-wise, the function is identical to |fbsql_fetch_array|, and almost as
quick as |fbsql_fetch_row| (the difference is insignificant).

{ result}A result identifier returned by |fbsql_query| or |fbsql_db_query|.

Returns an object with properties that correspond to the fetched row, or FALSE
if there are no more rows.

|fbsql_fetch_object| example

<?php >
  fbsql_connect($host, $user, $password);
  $result = fbsql_db_query("database", "select * from table");
  while ($row = fbsql_fetch_object($result)) {
      echo $row->user_id;
      echo $row->fullname;
  }
  fbsql_free_result($result);
?>
