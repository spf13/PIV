strftime -- Format a local time/date according to locale settings

  string strftime(string format [, int timestamp])~

Format the time and/or date according to locale settings. Month and weekday
names and other language-dependent strings respect the current locale set with
|setlocale|.

Not all conversion specifiers may be supported by your C library, in which
case they will not be supported by PHP's |strftime|. Additionally, not all
platforms support negative timestamps, so your date range may be limited to no
earlier than the Unix epoch. This means that %e, %T, %R and, %D (and possibly
others) - as well as dates prior to Jan 1, 1970 - will not work on Windows,
some Linux distributions, and a few other operating systems. For Windows
systems, a complete overview of supported conversion specifiers can be found
at MSDN.

{format} The following characters are recognized in the {format} parameter
string {format} Description Example returned values Day --- --- %a An
abbreviated textual representation of the day Sun through Sat %A A full
textual representation of the day Sunday through Saturday %d Two-digit day of
the month (with leading zeros) 01 to 31 %e Day of the month, with a space
preceding single digits. Not implemented as described on Windows. See below
for more information. 1 to 31 %j Day of the year, 3 digits with leading zeros
001 to 366 %u ISO-8601 numeric representation of the day of the week 1 (for
Monday) though 7 (for Sunday) %w Numeric representation of the day of the week
0 (for Sunday) through 6 (for Saturday) Week --- --- %U Week number of the
given year, starting with the first Sunday as the first week 13 (for the 13th
full week of the year) %V ISO-8601:1988 week number of the given year,
starting with the first week of the year with at least 4 weekdays, with Monday
being the start of the week 01 through 53 (where 53 accounts for an
overlapping week) %W A numeric representation of the week of the year,
starting with the first Monday as the first week 46 (for the 46th week of the
year beginning with a Monday) Month --- --- %b Abbreviated month name, based
on the locale Jan through Dec %B Full month name, based on the locale January
through December %h Abbreviated month name, based on the locale (an alias of
%b) Jan through Dec %m Two digit representation of the month 01 (for January)
through 12 (for December) Year --- --- %C Two digit representation of the
century (year divided by 100, truncated to an integer) 19 for the 20th Century
%g Two digit representation of the year going by ISO-8601:1988 standards (see
%V) Example: 09 for the week of January 6, 2009 %G The full four-digit version
of %g Example: 2008 for the week of January 3, 2009 %y Two digit
representation of the year Example: 09 for 2009, 79 for 1979 %Y Four digit
representation for the year Example: 2038 Time --- --- %H Two digit
representation of the hour in 24-hour format 00 through 23 %I Two digit
representation of the hour in 12-hour format 01 through 12 %l (lower-case 'L')
Hour in 12-hour format, with a space preceeding single digits 1 through 12 %M
Two digit representation of the minute 00 through 59 %p UPPER-CASE 'AM' or
'PM' based on the given time Example: AM for 00:31, PM for 22:23 %P lower-case
'am' or 'pm' based on the given time Example: am for 00:31, pm for 22:23 %r
Same as "%I:%M:%S %p" Example: 09:34:17 PM for 21:34:17 %R Same as "%H:%M"
Example: 00:35 for 12:35 AM, 16:44 for 4:44 PM %S Two digit representation of
the second 00 through 59 %T Same as "%H:%M:%S" Example: 21:34:17 for 09:34:17
PM %X Preferred time representation based on locale, without the date Example:
03:59:16 or 15:59:16 %z Either the time zone offset from UTC or the
abbreviation (depends on operating system) Example: -0500 or EST for Eastern
Time %Z The time zone offset/abbreviation option NOT given by %z (depends on
operating system) Example: -0500 or EST for Eastern Time Time and Date Stamps
--- --- %c Preferred date and time stamp based on local Example: Tue Feb 5
00:45:10 2009 for February 5, 2009 at 12:45:10 AM %D Same as "%m/%d/%y"
Example: 02/05/09 for February 5, 2009 %F Same as "%Y-%m-%d" (commonly used in
database datestamps) Example: 2009-02-05 for February 5, 2009 %s Unix Epoch
Time timestamp (same as the |time| function) Example: 305815200 for September
10, 1979 08:40:00 AM %x Preferred date representation based on locale, without
the time Example: 02/05/09 for February 5, 2009 Miscellaneous --- --- %n A
newline character ("\n") --- %t A Tab character ("\t") --- %% A literal
percentage character ("%") ---

Maximum length of this parameter is 1023 characters.

Contrary to ISO-9899:1999, Sun Solaris starts with Sunday as 1. As a result,
%u may not function as described in this manual.

Windows only: The %e modifier is not supported in the Windows implementation
of this function. To achieve this value, the %#d modifier can be used instead.
The example below illustrates how to write a cross platform compatible
function.

Mac OS X only: The %P modifier is not supported in the Mac OS X implementation
of this function.

{timestamp} The optional {timestamp} parameter is an integer Unix timestamp
that defaults to the current local time if a {timestamp} is not given. In
other words, it defaults to the value of |time|.

Returns a string formatted according {format} using the given {timestamp} or
the current local time if no timestamp is given. Month and weekday names and
other language-dependent strings respect the current locale set with
|setlocale|.

Every call to a date/time function will generate a E_NOTICE if the time zone
is not valid, and/or a E_STRICT or E_WARNING message if using the system
settings or the TZ environment variable. See also |date_default_timezone_set|

As the output is dependent upon the underlying C library, some conversion
specifiers are not supported. On Windows, supplying unknown conversion
specifiers will result in 5 E_WARNING messages and return FALSE. On other
operating systems you may not get any E_WARNING messages and the output may
contain the conversion specifiers unconverted.

Version Description 5.1.0 Now issues the E_STRICT and E_NOTICE time zone
errors.

This example will work if you have the respective locales installed in your
system. |strftime| locale examples

%G and %V, which are based on ISO 8601:1988 week numbers can give unexpected
(albeit correct) results if the numbering system is not thoroughly understood.
