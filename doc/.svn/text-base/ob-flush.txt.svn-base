ob_flush -- Flush (send) the output buffer

  void ob_flush()~

This function will send the contents of the output buffer (if any). If you
want to further process the buffer's contents you have to call
|ob_get_contents| before |ob_flush| as the buffer contents are discarded after
|ob_flush| is called.

This function does not destroy the output buffer like |ob_end_flush| does.

No value is returned.

|ob_get_contents| |ob_clean| |ob_end_flush| |ob_end_clean|
