ncurses_cbreak -- Switch of input buffering

  bool ncurses_cbreak()~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

Disables line buffering and character processing (interrupt and flow control
characters are unaffected), making characters typed by the user immediately
available to the program.

Returns TRUE or NCURSES_ERR if any error occurred.
