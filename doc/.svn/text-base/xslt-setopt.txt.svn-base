  mixed xslt_setopt(resource processor, int newmask)~

|xslt_setopt| sets the options specified by {newmask} on the given
{processor}.

{processor} The XSLT processor link identifier, created with |xslt_create|.

{newmask} {newmask} is a bitmask constructed with the following constants:
XSLT_SABOPT_PARSE_PUBLIC_ENTITIES - Tell the processor to parse public
entities. By default this has been turned off.

XSLT_SABOPT_DISABLE_ADDING_META - Do not add the meta tag "Content-Type" for
HTML output. The default is set during the compilation of the processor.

XSLT_SABOPT_DISABLE_STRIPPING - Suppress the whitespace stripping (on data
files only).

XSLT_SABOPT_IGNORE_DOC_NOT_FOUND - Consider unresolved documents (the
document() function) non-lethal.

Returns the number of previous mask is possible, TRUE otherwise, FALSE in case
of an error.
