fbsql_fetch_array -- Fetch a result row as an associative array, a numeric
array, or both

  array fbsql_fetch_array(resource result [, int result_type])~

|fbsql_fetch_array| is a combination of |fbsql_fetch_row| and
|fbsql_fetch_assoc|.

An important thing to note is that using |fbsql_fetch_array| is NOT
significantly slower than using |fbsql_fetch_row|, while it provides a
significant added value.

{ result}A result identifier returned by |fbsql_query| or |fbsql_db_query|.

{result_type} A constant and can take the following values: FBSQL_ASSOC,
FBSQL_NUM, or FBSQL_BOTH.

When using FBSQL_BOTH, in addition to storing the data in the numeric indices
of the result array, it also stores the data in associative indices, using the
field names as keys.

Returns an array that corresponds to the fetched row, or FALSE if there are no
more rows.

If two or more columns of the result have the same field names, the last
column will take precedence. To access the other column(s) of the same name,
you must the numeric index of the column or make an alias for the column.

  select t1.f1 as foo t2.f1 as bar from t1, t2

|fbsql_fetch_array| example

<?php >
  fbsql_connect($host, $user, $password);
  $result = fbsql_db_query("database", "select user_id, fullname from table");
  while ($row = fbsql_fetch_array($result)) {
      echo "user_id: " . $row["user_id"] . "<br />\n";
      echo "user_id: " . $row[0] . "<br />\n";
      echo "fullname: " . $row["fullname"] . "<br />\n";
      echo "fullname: " . $row[1] . "<br />\n";
  }
  fbsql_free_result($result);
?>
