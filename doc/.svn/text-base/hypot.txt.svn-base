hypot -- Calculate the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angle triangle

  float hypot(float x, float y)~

|hypot| returns the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angle triangle with
sides of length {x} and {y}, or the distance of the point ({x}, {y}) from the
origin. This is equivalent to sqrt(x*x + y*y).

{x} Length of first side

{y} Length of second side
