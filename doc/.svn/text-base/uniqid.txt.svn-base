uniqid -- Generate a unique ID

  string uniqid([string prefix [, bool more_entropy]])~

Gets a prefixed unique identifier based on the current time in microseconds.

{prefix} Can be useful, for instance, if you generate identifiers
simultaneously on several hosts that might happen to generate the identifier
at the same microsecond.

With an empty {prefix}, the returned string will be 13 characters long. If
{more_entropy} is TRUE, it will be 23 characters.

{more_entropy} If set to TRUE, |uniqid| will add additional entropy (using the
combined linear congruential generator) at the end of the return value, which
should make the results more unique.

Returns the unique identifier, as a string.

|uniqid| Example

<?php >
  /* A uniqid, like: 4b3403665fea6 */
  printf("uniqid(): %s\r\n", uniqid());
  
  /* We can also prefix the uniqid, this the same as 
   * doing:
   *
   * $uniqid = $prefix . uniqid();
   * $uniqid = uniqid($prefix);
   */
  printf("uniqid('php_'): %s\r\n", uniqid('php_'));
  
  /* We can also activate the more_entropy parameter, which is 
   * required on some systems, like Cygwin. This makes uniqid()
   * produce a value like: 4b340550242239.64159797
   */
  printf("uniqid('', true): %s\r\n", uniqid('', true));
?>





Version Description 5.0.0 The {prefix} parameter was made optional. 4.3.1 The
limit of 114 characters long for {prefix} was raised.

Under Cygwin, the {more_entropy} must be set to TRUE for this function to
work.
