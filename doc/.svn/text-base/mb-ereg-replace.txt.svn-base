mb_ereg_replace -- Replace regular expression with multibyte support

  string mb_ereg_replace(string pattern, string replacement, string string [, string option])~

Scans {string} for matches to {pattern}, then replaces the matched text with
{replacement}

{pattern} The regular expression pattern.

Multibyte characters may be used in {pattern}.

{replacement} The replacement text.

{string} The string being checked.

{option} Matching condition can be set by {option} parameter. If i is
specified for this parameter, the case will be ignored. If x is specified,
white space will be ignored. If m is specified, match will be executed in
multiline mode and line break will be included in '.'. If p is specified,
match will be executed in POSIX mode, line break will be considered as normal
character. If e is specified, {replacement} string will be evaluated as PHP
expression.

The resultant string on success, or FALSE on error.

The internal encoding or the character encoding specified by
|mb_regex_encoding| will be used as the character encoding for this function.

Never use the e modifier when working on untrusted input. No automatic
escaping will happen (as known from |preg_replace|). Not taking care of this
will most likely create remote code execution vulnerabilities in your
application.
