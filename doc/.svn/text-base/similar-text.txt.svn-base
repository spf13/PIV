similar_text -- Calculate the similarity between two strings

  int similar_text(string first, string second [, float percent])~

This calculates the similarity between two strings as described in Oliver
[1993]. Note that this implementation does not use a stack as in Oliver's
pseudo code, but recursive calls which may or may not speed up the whole
process. Note also that the complexity of this algorithm is O(N**3) where N is
the length of the longest string.

{first} The first string.

{second} The second string.

{percent} By passing a reference as third argument, |similar_text| will
calculate the similarity in percent for you.

Returns the number of matching chars in both strings.
