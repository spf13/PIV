fbsql_query -- Send a FrontBase query

  resource fbsql_query(string query [, resource link_identifier [, int batch_size]])~

Sends a {query} to the currently active database on the server.

If the query succeeds, you can call |fbsql_num_rows| to find out how many rows
were returned for a SELECT statement or |fbsql_affected_rows| to find out how
many rows were affected by a DELETE, INSERT, REPLACE, or UPDATE statement.

{query} The SQL query to be executed.

The query string shall always end with a semicolon.

{ link_identifier}A FrontBase link identifier returned by |fbsql_connect| or
|fbsql_pconnect|.

If optional and not specified, the function will try to find an open link to
the FrontBase server and if no such link is found it will try to create one as
if |fbsql_connect| was called with no arguments.

{batch_size}

|fbsql_query| returns TRUE (non-zero) or FALSE to indicate whether or not the
query succeeded. A return value of TRUE means that the query was legal and
could be executed by the server. It does not indicate anything about the
number of rows affected or returned. It is perfectly possible for a query to
succeed but affect no rows or return no rows.

For SELECT statements, |fbsql_query| returns a new result identifier that you
can pass to |fbsql_result|.

|fbsql_query| will also fail and return FALSE if you don't have permission to
access the table(s) referenced by the query.

The following query is syntactically invalid, so |fbsql_query| fails and
returns FALSE: |fbsql_query| example

<?php >
  $result = fbsql_query("SELECT * WHERE 1=1")
      or die ("Invalid query");
?>





The following query is semantically invalid if my_col is not a column in the
table my_tbl, so |fbsql_query| fails and returns FALSE: |fbsql_query| example

<?php >
  $result = fbsql_query ("SELECT my_col FROM my_tbl;")
      or die ("Invalid query");
?>





|fbsql_affected_rows| |fbsql_db_query| |fbsql_free_result| |fbsql_result|
|fbsql_select_db| |fbsql_connect|
