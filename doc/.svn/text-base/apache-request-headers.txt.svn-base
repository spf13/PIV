apache_request_headers -- Fetch all HTTP request headers

  array apache_request_headers()~

Fetches all HTTP request headers from the current request.

This function is only supported when PHP is installed as an Apache module.

An associative array of all the HTTP headers in the current request, or FALSE
on failure.

Version Description 4.3.3 As of PHP 4.3.3 you can use this function with the
NSAPI server module in Netscape/iPlanet/SunONE webservers, too.

4.3.0 Prior to PHP 4.3.0, |apache_request_headers| was called |getallheaders|.
After PHP 4.3.0, |getallheaders| is an alias for |apache_request_headers|.

|apache_request_headers| example

<?php >
  $headers = apache_request_headers();
  
  foreach ($headers as $header => $value) {
      echo "$header: $value <br />\n";
  }
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  Accept: */*
  Accept-Language: en-us
  Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
  User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0
  Host: www.example.com
  Connection: Keep-Alive



You can also get at the value of the common CGI variables by reading them from
the environment, which works whether or not you are using PHP as an Apache
module. Use |phpinfo| to see a list of all of the available environment
variables.
