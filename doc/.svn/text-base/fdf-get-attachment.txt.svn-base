fdf_get_attachment -- Extracts uploaded file embedded in the FDF

  array fdf_get_attachment(resource fdf_document, string fieldname, string savepath)~

Extracts a file uploaded by means of the "file selection" field {fieldname}
and stores it under {savepath}.

{fdf_document} The FDF document handle, returned by |fdf_create|, |fdf_open|
or |fdf_open_string|.

{fieldname}

{savepath} May be the name of a plain file or an existing directory in which
the file is to be created under its original name. Any existing file under the
same name will be overwritten.

There seems to be no other way to find out the original filename but to store
the file using a directory as {savepath} and check for the basename it was
stored under.

The returned array contains the following fields: {path} - path were the file
got stored

{size} - size of the stored file in bytes

{type} - mimetype if given in the FDF

Storing an uploaded file

<?php >
    $fdf = fdf_open_string($HTTP_FDF_DATA);
    $data = fdf_get_attachment($fdf, "filename", "/tmpdir");
    echo "The uploaded file is stored in $data[path]";
?>
