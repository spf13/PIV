dio_fcntl -- Performs a c library fcntl on fd

  mixed dio_fcntl(resource fd, int cmd [, mixed args])~

The |dio_fcntl| function performs the operation specified by {cmd} on the file
descriptor {fd}. Some commands require additional arguments {args} to be
supplied.

{fd} The file descriptor returned by |dio_open|.

{cmd} Can be one of the following operations: F_SETLK - Lock is set or
cleared. If the lock is held by someone else |dio_fcntl| returns -1.

F_SETLKW - like F_SETLK, but in case the lock is held by someone else,
|dio_fcntl| waits until the lock is released.

F_GETLK - |dio_fcntl| returns an associative array (as described above) if
someone else prevents lock. If there is no obstruction key "type" will set to
F_UNLCK.

F_DUPFD - finds the lowest numbered available file descriptor greater than or
equal to {args} and returns them.

F_SETFL - Sets the file descriptors flags to the value specified by {args},
which can be O_APPEND, O_NONBLOCK or O_ASYNC. To use O_ASYNC you will need to
use the PCNTL extension.

{args} {args} is an associative array, when {cmd} is F_SETLK or F_SETLLW, with
the following keys: "start" - offset where lock begins

"length" - size of locked area. zero means to end of file

"wenth" - Where l_start is relative to: can be SEEK_SET, SEEK_END and SEEK_CUR

"type" - type of lock: can be F_RDLCK (read lock), F_WRLCK (write lock) or
F_UNLCK (unlock)

Returns the result of the C call.

Setting and clearing a lock

<?php >
  $fd = dio_open('/dev/ttyS0', O_RDWR);
  
  if (dio_fcntl($fd, F_SETLK, Array("type"=>F_WRLCK)) == -1) {
     // the file descriptor appears locked
     echo "The lock can not be cleared. It is held by someone else.";
  } else {
     echo "Lock succesfully set/cleared";
  }
  
  dio_close($fd);
?>
