sybase_fetch_object -- Fetch a row as an object

  object sybase_fetch_object(resource result [, mixed object])~

|sybase_fetch_object| is similar to |sybase_fetch_assoc|, with one difference
- an object is returned, instead of an array.

Speed-wise, the function is identical to |sybase_fetch_array|, and almost as
quick as |sybase_fetch_row| (the difference is insignificant).

{result}

{object} Use the second {object} to specify the type of object you want to
return. If this parameter is omitted, the object will be of type stdClass.

Returns an object with properties that correspond to the fetched row, or FALSE
if there are no more rows.

Version Description 4.3.0 This function will no longer return numeric object
members. Old behaviour:

  object(stdclass)(3) {
    [0]=>
    string(3) "foo"
    ["foo"]=>
    string(3) "foo"
    [1]=>
    string(3) "bar"
    ["bar"]=>
    string(3) "bar"
  }

New behaviour:

  object(stdclass)(3) {
    ["foo"]=>
    string(3) "foo"
    ["bar"]=>
    string(3) "bar"
  }



|sybase_fetch_object| return as Foo

<?php >
      class Foo {
          var $foo, $bar, $baz;
      }
  
      // {...]
      $qrh= sybase_query('SELECT foo, bar, baz FROM example');
      $foo= sybase_fetch_object($qrh, 'Foo');
      $bar= sybase_fetch_object($qrh, new Foo());
      // {...]
?>
