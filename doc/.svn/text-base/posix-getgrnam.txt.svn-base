posix_getgrnam -- Return info about a group by name

  array posix_getgrnam(string name)~

Gets information about a group provided its name.

{name} The name of the group

The array elements returned are: The group information array Element
Description name The name element contains the name of the group. This is a
short, usually less than 16 character "handle" of the group, not the real,
full name. This should be the same as the {name} parameter used when calling
the function, and hence redundant. passwd The passwd element contains the
group's password in an encrypted format. Often, for example on a system
employing "shadow" passwords, an asterisk is returned instead. gid Group ID of
the group in numeric form. members This consists of an array of string's for
all the members in the group.

Version Description 4.2.0 Prior to this version, members was simply an integer
representing the number of members in the group, and the member names were
returned with numerical indices.

Example use of |posix_getgrnam|

<?php >
  $groupinfo = posix_getgrnam("toons");
  
  print_r($groupinfo);
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  Array
  (
      [name]    => toons
      [passwd]  => x
      [members] => Array
          (
              [0] => tom
              [1] => jerry
          )
      [gid]     => 42
  )
