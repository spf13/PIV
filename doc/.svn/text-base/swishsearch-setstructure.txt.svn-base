Basic |SwishSearch->setStructure| example

<?php >
  try {
  
      $swish = new Swish("index.swish-e");
      $search = $swish->prepare();
  
      $results = $search->execute("time");
      echo "First query found: ", $results->hits, " hits\n";
  
      $search->setStructure(Swish::IN_TITLE|Swish::IN_HEAD); //search in title and head
      $results = $search->execute("time");
      echo "Second query found: ", $results->hits, " hits\n";
  
      $search->setStructure(Swish::IN_ALL); //search in whole document, the default value
      $results = $search->execute("time");
      echo "Third query found: ", $results->hits, " hits\n";
  
  } catch (SwishException $e) {
      echo $e->getMessage(), "\n";
  }
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  First query found: 5 hits
  Second query found: 0 hits
  Third query found: 5 hits
