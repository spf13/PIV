parse_url -- Parse a URL and return its components

  mixed parse_url(string url [, int component])~

This function parses a URL and returns an associative array containing any of
the various components of the URL that are present.

This function is not meant to validate the given URL, it only breaks it up
into the above listed parts. Partial URLs are also accepted, |parse_url| tries
its best to parse them correctly.

{url} The URL to parse. Invalid characters are replaced by _.

{component} Specify one of PHP_URL_SCHEME, PHP_URL_HOST, PHP_URL_PORT,
PHP_URL_USER, PHP_URL_PASS, PHP_URL_PATH, PHP_URL_QUERY or PHP_URL_FRAGMENT to
retrieve just a specific URL component as a string (except when PHP_URL_PORT
is given, in which case the return value will be an integer).

On seriously malformed URLs, |parse_url| may return FALSE.

If the {component} parameter is omitted, an associative array is returned. At
least one element will be present within the array. Potential keys within this
array are: scheme - e.g. http

host

port

user

pass

path

query - after the question mark ?

fragment - after the hashmark #

If the {component} parameter is specified, |parse_url| returns a string (or an
integer, in the case of PHP_URL_PORT) instead of an array. If the requested
component doesn't exist within the given URL, NULL will be returned.

Version Description 5.3.3 Removed the E_WARNING that was emitted when URL
parsing failed. 5.1.2 Added the {component} parameter.

A |parse_url| example

<?php >
  $url = 'http://username:password@hostname/path?arg=value#anchor';
  
  print_r(parse_url($url));
  
  echo parse_url($url, PHP_URL_PATH);
?>

The above example will output:

  Array
  (
      [scheme] => http
      [host] => hostname
      [user] => username
      [pass] => password
      [path] => /path
      [query] => arg=value
      [fragment] => anchor
  )
  /path



This function doesn't work with relative URLs.

This function is intended specifically for the purpose of parsing URLs and not
URIs. However, to comply with PHP's backwards compatibility requirements it
makes an exception for the file:// scheme where triple slashes (file:///...)
are allowed. For any other scheme this is invalid.

|pathinfo| |parse_str| |http_build_query| |http_build_url| |dirname|
|basename|
