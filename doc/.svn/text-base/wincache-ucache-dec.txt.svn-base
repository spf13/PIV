  mixed wincache_ucache_dec(string key [, int dec_by [, bool success]])~

{key} The {key} that was used to store the variable in the cache. {key} is
case sensitive.

{dec_by} The value by which the variable associated with the {key} will get
decremented. If the argument is a floating point number it will be truncated
to nearest integer. The variable associated with the {key} should be of type
long, otherwise the function fails and returns FALSE.
