PDO::pgsqlLOBCreate -- Creates a new large object

  string PDO::pgsqlLOBCreate()~

|PDO::pgsqlLOBCreate| creates a large object and returns the OID of that
object. You may then open a stream on the object using |PDO::pgsqlLOBOpen| to
read or write data to it. The OID can be stored in columns of type OID and be
used to reference the large object, without causing the row to grow
arbitrarily large. The large object will continue to live in the database
until it is removed by calling |PDO::pgsqlLOBUnlink|.

Large objects can be up to 2GB in size, but are cumbersome to use; you need to
ensure that |PDO::pgsqlLOBUnlink| is called prior to deleting the last row
that references its OID from your database. In addition, large objects have no
access controls. As an alternative, try the bytea column type; recent versions
of PostgreSQL allow bytea columns of up to 1GB in size and transparently
manage the storage for optimal row size.

This function must be called within a transaction.

|PDO::pgsqlLOBCreate| takes no parameters.

Returns the OID of the newly created large object on success, or FALSE on
failure.

A |PDO::pgsqlLOBCreate| example This example creates a new large object and
copies the contents of a file into it. The OID is then stored into a table.

<?php >
  $db = new PDO('pgsql:dbname=test host=localhost', $user, $pass);
  $db->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);
  $db->beginTransaction();
  $oid = $db->pgsqlLOBCreate();
  $stream = $db->pgsqlLOBOpen($oid, 'w');
  $local = fopen($filename, 'rb');
  stream_copy_to_stream($local, $stream);
  $local = null;
  $stream = null;
  $stmt = $db->prepare("INSERT INTO BLOBS (ident, oid) VALUES (?, ?)");
  $stmt->execute(array($some_id, $oid));
  $db->commit();
?>
