SDO_DAS_XML::addTypes -- To load a second or subsequent schema file to a
SDO_DAS_XML object

  void SDO_DAS_XML::addTypes(string xsd_file)~

Load a second or subsequent schema file to an XML DAS that has already been
created with the static method |create|. Although the file may be any valid
schema file, a likely reason for using this method is to add a schema file
containing definitions of extra complex types, hence the name. See Example 4
of the parent document for an example.

{xsd_file} Path to XSD Schema file.

XSD File.
