udm_alloc_agent -- Allocate mnoGoSearch session

  resource udm_alloc_agent(string dbaddr [, string dbmode])~

Allocate a mnoGoSearch session.

{dbaddr} {dbaddr} - URL-style database description, with options (type, host,
database name, port, user and password) to connect to SQL database. Do not
matter for built-in text files support. Format for {dbaddr}:
DBType:[//[DBUser[:DBPass]@]DBHost[:DBPort]]/DBName/. Currently supported
DBType values are: mysql, pgsql, msql, solid, mssql, oracle, and ibase.
Actually, it does not matter for native libraries support, but ODBC users
should specify one of the supported values. If your database type is not
supported, you may use unknown instead.

{dbmode} {dbmode} - You may select the SQL database mode of words storage.
Possible values of {dbmode} are: single, multi, crc, or crc-multi. When single
is specified, all words are stored in the same table. If multi is selected,
words will be located in different tables depending of their lengths. "multi"
mode is usually faster, but requires more tables in the database. If "crc"
mode is selected, mnoGoSearch will store 32 bit integer word IDs calculated by
CRC32 algorithm instead of words. This mode requires less disk space and it is
faster comparing with "single" and "multi" modes. crc-multi uses the same
storage structure with the "crc" mode, but also stores words in different
tables depending on words lengths like in "multi" mode.

{dbaddr} and {dbmode} must match those used during indexing.

Returns a mnogosearch agent identifier on success, FALSE on failure. This
function creates a session with database parameters.

In fact this function does not open a connection to the database and thus does
not check the entered login and password. Establishing a connection to the
database and login/password verification is done by |udm_find|.
