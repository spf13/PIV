openssl_x509_parse -- Parse an X509 certificate and return the information as
an array

  array openssl_x509_parse(mixed x509cert [, bool shortnames])~

|openssl_x509_parse| returns information about the supplied {x509cert},
including fields such as subject name, issuer name, purposes, valid from and
valid to dates etc.

{x509cert}

{shortnames} {shortnames} controls how the data is indexed in the array - if
{shortnames} is TRUE (the default) then fields will be indexed with the short
name form, otherwise, the long name form will be used - e.g.: CN is the
shortname form of commonName.

The structure of the returned data is (deliberately) not yet documented, as it
is still subject to change.
