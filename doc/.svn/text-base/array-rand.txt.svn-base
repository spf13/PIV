array_rand -- Pick one or more random entries out of an array

  mixed array_rand(array input [, int num_req])~

Picks one or more random entries out of an array, and returns the key (or
keys) of the random entries.

{input} The input array.

{num_req} Specifies how many entries you want to pick. Trying to pick more
elements than there are in the array will result in an E_WARNING level error.

If you are picking only one entry, |array_rand| returns the key for a random
entry. Otherwise, it returns an array of keys for the random entries. This is
done so that you can pick random keys as well as values out of the array.

Version Description 5.2.10 The resulting array of keys is no longer shuffled.
4.2.0The random number generator is seeded automatically.

|array_rand| example

<?php >
  $input = array("Neo", "Morpheus", "Trinity", "Cypher", "Tank");
  $rand_keys = array_rand($input, 2);
  echo $input[$rand_keys[0]] . "\n";
  echo $input[$rand_keys[1]] . "\n";
?>
