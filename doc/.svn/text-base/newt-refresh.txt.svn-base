newt_refresh -- Updates modified portions of the screen

  void newt_refresh()~

To increase performance, newt only updates the display when it needs to, not
when the program tells it to write to the terminal. Applications can force
newt to immediately update modified portions of the screen by calling this
function.

No value is returned.
