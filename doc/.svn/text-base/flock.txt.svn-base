flock -- Portable advisory file locking

  bool flock(resource handle, int operation [, int wouldblock])~

|flock| allows you to perform a simple reader/writer model which can be used
on virtually every platform (including most Unix derivatives and even
Windows).

On versions of PHP before 5.3.2, the lock is released also by |fclose| (which
is also called automatically when script finished).

PHP supports a portable way of locking complete files in an advisory way
(which means all accessing programs have to use the same way of locking or it
will not work). By default, this function will block until the requested lock
is acquired; this may be controlled (on non-Windows platforms) with the
LOCK_NB option documented below.

{handle} A file system pointer resource that is typically created using
|fopen|.

{operation} {operation} is one of the following: LOCK_SH to acquire a shared
lock (reader).

LOCK_EX to acquire an exclusive lock (writer).

LOCK_UN to release a lock (shared or exclusive).

It is also possible to add LOCK_NB as a bitmask to one of the above operations
if you don't want |flock| to block while locking. (not supported on Windows)

{wouldblock} The optional third argument is set to TRUE if the lock would
block (EWOULDBLOCK errno condition). (not supported on Windows)

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

Version Description 5.3.2 The automatic unlocking when the file's resource
handle is closed was removed. Unlocking now always has to be done manually.
4.0.1 The LOCK_XXX constants were added. Prior to that you must use 1 for
LOCK_SH, 2 for LOCK_EX, 3 for LOCK_UN and 4 for LOCK_NB

|flock| example

<?php >
  $fp = fopen("/tmp/lock.txt", "r+");
  
  if (flock($fp, LOCK_EX)) { // do an exclusive lock
      ftruncate($fp, 0); // truncate file
      fwrite($fp, "Write something here\n");
      flock($fp, LOCK_UN); // release the lock
  } else {
      echo "Couldn't get the lock!";
  }
  
  fclose($fp);
?>





|flock| using the LOCK_NB option

<?php >
  $fp = fopen('/tmp/lock.txt', 'r+');
  
  /* Activate the LOCK_NB option on an LOCK_EX operation */
  if(!flock($fp, LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)) {
      echo 'Unable to obtain lock';
      exit(-1);
  }
  
  /* ... */
  
  fclose($fp);
?>





|flock| uses mandatory locking instead of advisory locking on Windows.
Mandatory locking is also supported on Linux and System V based operating
systems via the usual mechanism supported by the fcntl() system call: that is,
if the file in question has the setgid permission bit set and the group
execution bit cleared. On Linux, the file system will also need to be mounted
with the mand option for this to work.

Because |flock| requires a file pointer, you may have to use a special lock
file to protect access to a file that you intend to truncate by opening it in
write mode (with a "w" or "w+" argument to |fopen|).

May only be used on file pointers returned by |fopen| for local files, or file
pointers pointing to userspace streams that implement the
|streamWrapper::stream_lock| method.

Assigning another value to {handle} argument in subsequent code will release
the lock.

On some operating systems |flock| is implemented at the process level. When
using a multithreaded server API like ISAPI you may not be able to rely on
|flock| to protect files against other PHP scripts running in parallel threads
of the same server instance!

|flock| is not supported on antiquated filesystems like FAT and its derivates
and will therefore always return FALSE under this environments (this is
especially true for Windows 98 users).
