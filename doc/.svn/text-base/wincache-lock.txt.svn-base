wincache_lock -- Acquires an exclusive lock on a given key

  bool wincache_lock(string key [, bool isglobal])~

Obtains an exclusive lock on a given key. The execution of the current script
will be blocked until the lock can be obtained. Once the lock is obtained, the
other scripts that try to request the lock by using the same key will be
blocked, until the current script releases the lock by using
|wincache_unlock|.

Using of the |wincache_lock| and |wincache_unlock| can cause deadlocks when
executing PHP scripts in a multi-process environment like FastCGI. Do not use
these functions unless you are absolutely sure you need to use them. For the
majority of the operations on the user cache it is not necessary to use these
functions.

{key} Name of the key in the cache to get the lock on.

{isglobal} Controls whether the scope of the lock is system-wide or local.
Local locks are scoped to the application pool in IIS FastCGI case or to all
php processes that have the same parent process identifier.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

Using |wincache_lock|

<?php >
  $fp = fopen("/tmp/lock.txt", "r+");
  if (wincache_lock(“lock_txt_lock”)) { // do an exclusive lock
      ftruncate($fp, 0); // truncate file
      fwrite($fp, "Write something here\n");
      wincache_unlock(“lock_txt_lock”); // release the lock
  } else {
      echo "Couldn't get the lock!";
  }
  fclose($fp);
?>
