wincache_refresh_if_changed -- Refreshes the cache entries for the cached
files

  bool wincache_refresh_if_changed([array files])~

Refreshes the cache entries for the files, whose names were passed in the
input argument. If no argument is specified then refreshes all the entries in
the cache.

{files} An array of file names for files that need to be refreshed. An
absolute or relative file paths can be used.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

WinCache performs regular checks on the cached files to ensure that if any
file has changed then the corresponding entry in the cache is updated. By
default this check is performed every 30 seconds. If, for example, a PHP
script updates another PHP script where the application's configuration
settings are stored, then it may happen that after the configuration settings
have been saved to a file, the application is still using old settings for
some time until the cache is refreshed. In those cases it may be preferrable
to refresh the cache right after the file has been changed. The following
example shows how this can be done. A |wincache_refresh_if_changed| example

<?php >
  $filename = 'C:\inetpub\wwwroot\config.php';
  $handle = fopen($filename, 'w+');
  if ($handle === FALSE) die('Failed to open file '.$filename.' for writing');
  fwrite($handle, '<?php $setting=something; ?>');
  fclose($handle);
  wincache_refresh_if_changed(array($filename));
?>
