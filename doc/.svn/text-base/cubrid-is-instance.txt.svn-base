  $sql = <<<EOD
  SELECT host_year, medal, game_date 
  FROM game 
  WHERE athlete_code IN 
      (SELECT code FROM athlete WHERE name='Thorpe Ian');
  EOD;
  
  $req = cubrid_execute($conn, $sql, CUBRID_INCLUDE_OID);
  $oid = cubrid_current_oid($req);
  
  $res = cubrid_is_instance ($conn, $oid);
  if ($res == 1) {
      echo "Instance pointed by $oid exists.\n";
  } else if ($res == 0){
      echo "Instance pointed by $oid doesn't exist.\n";
  } else {
