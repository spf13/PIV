variant_round -- Rounds a variant to the specified number of decimal places

  mixed variant_round(mixed variant, int decimals)~

Returns the value of {variant} rounded to {decimals} decimal places.

{variant} The variant.

{decimals} Number of decimal places.

As with all the variant arithmetic functions, the parameters for this function
can be either a PHP native type (integer, string, floating point, boolean or
NULL), or an instance of a COM, VARIANT or DOTNET class. PHP native types will
be converted to variants using the same rules as found in the constructor for
the class. COM and DOTNET objects will have the value of their default
property taken and used as the variant value.

The variant arithmetic functions are wrappers around the similarly named
functions in the COM library; for more information on these functions, consult
the MSDN library. The PHP functions are named slightly differently; for
example |variant_add| in PHP corresponds to VarAdd() in the MSDN
documentation.

Returns the rounded value.
