socket_get_option -- Gets socket options for the socket

  mixed socket_get_option(resource socket, int level, int optname)~

The |socket_get_option| function retrieves the value for the option specified
by the {optname} parameter for the specified {socket}.

{socket} A valid socket resource created with |socket_create| or
|socket_accept|.

{level} The {level} parameter specifies the protocol level at which the option
resides. For example, to retrieve options at the socket level, a {level}
parameter of SOL_SOCKET would be used. Other levels, such as TCP, can be used
by specifying the protocol number of that level. Protocol numbers can be found
by using the |getprotobyname| function.

{optname} Available Socket Options Option Description Type SO_DEBUG Reports
whether debugging information is being recorded. int SO_BROADCAST Reports
whether transmission of broadcast messages is supported. int SO_REUSEADDR
Reports whether local addresses can be reused. int SO_KEEPALIVE Reports
whether connections are kept active with periodic transmission of messages. If
the connected socket fails to respond to these messages, the connection is
broken and processes writing to that socket are notified with a SIGPIPE
signal. int SO_LINGER Reports whether the {socket} lingers on |socket_close|
if data is present. By default, when the socket is closed, it attempts to send
all unsent data. In the case of a connection-oriented socket, |socket_close|
will wait for its peer to acknowledge the data.

If l_onoff is non-zero and l_linger is zero, all the unsent data will be
discarded and RST (reset) is sent to the peer in the case of a
connection-oriented socket.

On the other hand, if l_onoff is non-zero and l_linger is non-zero,
|socket_close| will block until all the data is sent or the time specified in
l_linger elapses. If the socket is non-blocking, |socket_close| will fail and
return an error.

array. The array will contain two keys: l_onoff and l_linger. SO_OOBINLINE
Reports whether the {socket} leaves out-of-band data inline. int SO_SNDBUF
Reports the size of the send buffer. int SO_RCVBUF Reports the size of the
receive buffer. int SO_ERROR Reports information about error status and clears
it. int (cannot be set by |socket_set_option|) SO_TYPE Reports the {socket}
type (e.g. SOCK_STREAM). int (cannot be set by |socket_set_option|)
SO_DONTROUTE Reports whether outgoing messages bypass the standard routing
facilities. int SO_RCVLOWAT Reports the minimum number of bytes to process for
{socket} input operations. int SO_RCVTIMEO Reports the timeout value for input
operations. array. The array will contain two keys: sec which is the seconds
part on the timeout value and usec which is the microsecond part of the
timeout value. SO_SNDTIMEO Reports the timeout value specifying the amount of
time that an output function blocks because flow control prevents data from
being sent. array. The array will contain two keys: sec which is the seconds
part on the timeout value and usec which is the microsecond part of the
timeout value. SO_SNDLOWAT Reports the minimum number of bytes to process for
{socket} output operations. int TCP_NODELAY Reports whether the Nagle TCP
algorithm is disabled. int

Returns the value of the given option, or FALSE on errors.

|socket_set_option| example

<?php >
  $socket = socket_create_listen(1223);
  
  $linger = array('l_linger' => 1, 'l_onoff' => 1);
  socket_set_option($socket, SOL_SOCKET, SO_LINGER, $linger);
  
  var_dump(socket_get_option($socket, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR));
?>





Version Description 4.3.0 The name of this function was changed. It used to be
called socket_getopt().
