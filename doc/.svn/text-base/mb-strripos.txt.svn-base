mb_strripos -- Finds position of last occurrence of a string within another,
case insensitive

  int mb_strripos(string haystack, string needle [, int offset [, string encoding]])~

|mb_strripos| performs multi-byte safe |strripos| operation based on number of
characters. {needle} position is counted from the beginning of {haystack}.
First character's position is 0. Second character position is 1. Unlike
|mb_strrpos|, |mb_strripos| is case-insensitive.

{haystack} The string from which to get the position of the last occurrence of
{needle}

{needle} The string to find in {haystack}

{offset} The position in {haystack} to start searching

{encoding} Character encoding name to use. If it is omitted, internal
character encoding is used.

Return the numeric position of the last occurrence of {needle} in the
{haystack} string, or FALSE if {needle} is not found.
