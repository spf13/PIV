cubrid_connect_with_url -- Establish the environment for connecting to CUBRID
server

  resource cubrid_connect_with_url(string conn_url [, string userid [, string passwd]])~

The |cubrid_connect_with_url| function is used to establish the environment
for connecting to your server by using connection information passed with an
url string argument. If the HA feature is enabled in CUBRID, you must specify
the connection information of the standby server, which is used for failover
when failure occurs, in the url string argument of this function. If the user
name and password is not given, then the "PUBLIC" connection will be made by
default.
