newt_wait_for_key -- Doesn't return until a key has been pressed

  void newt_wait_for_key()~

This function doesn't return until a key has been pressed. The keystroke is
then ignored. If a key is already in the terminal's buffer, this function
discards a keystroke and returns immediately.

No value is returned.
