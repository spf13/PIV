odbc_pconnect -- Open a persistent database connection

  resource odbc_pconnect(string dsn, string user, string password [, int cursor_type])~

Opens a persistent database connection.

This function is much like |odbc_connect|, except that the connection is not
really closed when the script has finished. Future requests for a connection
with the same {dsn}, {user}, {password} combination (via |odbc_connect| and
|odbc_pconnect|) can reuse the persistent connection.

See |odbc_connect| for details.

Returns an ODBC connection id or 0 (FALSE) on error.

Persistent connections have no effect if PHP is used as a CGI program.
