ftell -- Returns the current position of the file read/write pointer

  int ftell(resource handle)~

Returns the position of the file pointer referenced by {handle}.

{handle} The file pointer must be valid, and must point to a file successfully
opened by |fopen| or |popen|. |ftell| gives undefined results for append-only
streams (opened with "a" flag).

Returns the position of the file pointer referenced by {handle} as an integer;
i.e., its offset into the file stream.

If an error occurs, returns FALSE.

|ftell| example

<?php >
  // opens a file and read some data
  $fp = fopen("/etc/passwd", "r");
  $data = fgets($fp, 12);
  
  // where are we ?
  echo ftell($fp); // 11
  
  fclose($fp);
?>
