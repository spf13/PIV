event_buffer_watermark_set -- Set the watermarks for read and write events

  void event_buffer_watermark_set(resource bevent, int events, int lowmark, int highmark)~

Sets the watermarks for read and write events. Libevent does not invoke read
callback unless there is at least {lowmark} bytes in the input buffer; if the
read buffer is beyond the {highmark}, reading is stopped. On output, the write
callback is invoked whenever the buffered data falls below the {lowmark}.

{bevent} Valid buffered event resource.

{events} Any combination of EV_READ and EV_WRITE.

{lowmark} Low watermark.

{highmark} High watermark.
