pg_tty -- Return the TTY name associated with the connection

  string pg_tty([resource connection])~

|pg_tty| returns the TTY name that server side debugging output is sent to on
the given PostgreSQL {connection} resource.

|pg_tty| is obsolete, since the server no longer pays attention to the TTY
setting, but the function remains for backwards compatibility.

{connection} PostgreSQL database connection resource. When {connection} is not
present, the default connection is used. The default connection is the last
connection made by |pg_connect| or |pg_pconnect|.

A string containing the debug TTY of the {connection}, or FALSE on error.

|pg_tty| example

<?php >
  $pgsql_conn = pg_connect("dbname=mark host=localhost");
  
  if ($pgsql_conn) {
     print "Server debug TTY is: " . pg_tty($pgsql_conn) . "<br/>\n";
  } else {
     print pg_last_error($pgsql_conn);
     exit;
  }
?>
