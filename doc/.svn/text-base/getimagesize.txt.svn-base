getimagesize -- Get the size of an image

  array getimagesize(string filename [, array imageinfo])~

The |getimagesize| function will determine the size of any given image file
and return the dimensions along with the file type and a height/width text
string to be used inside a normal HTML IMG tag and the correspondant HTTP
content type.

|getimagesize| can also return some more information in {imageinfo} parameter.

Note that JPC and JP2 are capable of having components with different bit
depths. In this case, the value for "bits" is the highest bit depth
encountered. Also, JP2 files may contain multiple JPEG 2000 codestreams. In
this case, |getimagesize| returns the values for the first codestream it
encounters in the root of the file.

The information about icons are retrieved from the icon with the highest
bitrate.

{filename} This parameter specifies the file you wish to retrieve information
about. It can reference a local file or (configuration permitting) a remote
file using one of the supported streams.

{imageinfo} This optional parameter allows you to extract some extended
information from the image file. Currently, this will return the different JPG
APP markers as an associative array. Some programs use these APP markers to
embed text information in images. A very common one is to embed IPTC
information in the APP13 marker. You can use the |iptcparse| function to parse
the binary APP13 marker into something readable.

Returns an array with 7 elements.

Index 0 and 1 contains respectively the width and the height of the image.

Some formats may contain no image or may contain multiple images. In these
cases, |getimagesize| might not be able to properly determine the image size.
|getimagesize| will return zero for width and height in these cases.

Index 2 is one of the IMAGETYPE_XXX constants indicating the type of the
image.

Index 3 is a text string with the correct height="yyy" width="xxx" string that
can be used directly in an IMG tag.

mime is the correspondant MIME type of the image. This information can be used
to deliver images with correct the HTTP Content-type header: |getimagesize|
and MIME types

<?php >
  $size = getimagesize($filename);
  $fp = fopen($filename, "rb");
  if ($size &amp;& $fp) {
      header("Content-type: {$size['mime']}");
      fpassthru($fp);
      exit;
  } else {
      // error
  }
?>





channels will be 3 for RGB pictures and 4 for CMYK pictures.

bits is the number of bits for each color.

For some image types, the presence of channels and bits values can be a bit
confusing. As an example, GIF always uses 3 channels per pixel, but the number
of bits per pixel cannot be calculated for an animated GIF with a global color
table.

On failure, FALSE is returned.

If accessing the {filename} image is impossible, or if it isn't a valid
picture, |getimagesize| will generate an error of level E_WARNING. On read
error, |getimagesize| will generate an error of level E_NOTICE.

Version Description 5.3.0 Added icon support. 5.2.3 Read errors generated by
this function downgraded to E_NOTICE from E_WARNING. 4.3.2 Support for JPC,
JP2, JPX, JB2, XBM, and WBMP became available. 4.3.2 JPEG 2000 support was
added for the {imageinfo} parameter. 4.3.0 bits and channels are present for
other image types, too. 4.3.0 mime was added. 4.3.0 Support for SWC and IFF
was added. 4.2.0 Support for TIFF was added. 4.0.6 Support for BMP and PSD was
added. 4.0.5 URL support was added.

|getimagesize| example

<?php >
  list($width, $height, $type, $attr) = getimagesize("img/flag.jpg");
  echo "<img src=\"img/flag.jpg\" $attr alt=\"getimagesize() example\" />";
?>



getimagesize (URL)

<?php >
  $size = getimagesize("http://www.example.com/gifs/logo.gif");
  
  // if the file name has space in it, encode it properly
  $size = getimagesize("http://www.example.com/gifs/lo%20go.gif");
?>



getimagesize() returning IPTC

<?php >
  $size = getimagesize("testimg.jpg", $info);
  if (isset($info["APP13"])) {
      $iptc = iptcparse($info["APP13"]);
      var_dump($iptc);
  }
?>





This function does not require the GD image library.
