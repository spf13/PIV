fpassthru -- Output all remaining data on a file pointer

  int fpassthru(resource handle)~

Reads to EOF on the given file pointer from the current position and writes
the results to the output buffer.

You may need to call |rewind| to reset the file pointer to the beginning of
the file if you have already written data to the file.

If you just want to dump the contents of a file to the output buffer, without
first modifying it or seeking to a particular offset, you may want to use the
|readfile|, which saves you the |fopen| call.

{handle} The file pointer must be valid, and must point to a file successfully
opened by |fopen| or |fsockopen| (and not yet closed by |fclose|).

If an error occurs, |fpassthru| returns FALSE. Otherwise, |fpassthru| returns
the number of characters read from {handle} and passed through to the output.

Using |fpassthru| with binary files

<?php >
  // open the file in a binary mode
  $name = './img/ok.png';
  $fp = fopen($name, 'rb');
  
  // send the right headers
  header("Content-Type: image/png");
  header("Content-Length: " . filesize($name));
  
  // dump the picture and stop the script
  fpassthru($fp);
  exit;
?>





When using |fpassthru| on a binary file on Windows systems, you should make
sure to open the file in binary mode by appending a b to the mode used in the
call to |fopen|.

You are encouraged to use the b flag when dealing with binary files, even if
your system does not require it, so that your scripts will be more portable.
