getallheaders -- Fetch all HTTP request headers

  array getallheaders()~

Fetches all HTTP headers from the current request.

This function is an alias for |apache_request_headers|. Please read the
|apache_request_headers| documentation for more information on how this
function works.

This function is only supported when PHP is installed as an Apache module.

An associative array of all the HTTP headers in the current request, or FALSE
on failure.

Version Description 4.3.0 Became an alias for |apache_request_headers|.
Essentially, it was renamed. This is because this function only works with
Apache.

|getallheaders| example

<?php >
  foreach (getallheaders() as $name => $value) {
      echo "$name: $value\n";
  }
?>





As of PHP 4.3.3 you can use this function with the NSAPI server module in
Netscape/iPlanet/SunONE webservers, too.
