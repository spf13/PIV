  string pg_fetch_result(resource result, int row, mixed field)~

  string pg_fetch_result(resource result, int row, mixed field, resource result, mixed field)~

|pg_fetch_result| returns the value of a particular row and field (column) in
a PostgreSQL result resource.

This function used to be called |pg_result|.

{result} PostgreSQL query result resource, returned by |pg_query|,
|pg_query_params| or |pg_execute| (among others).

{row} Row number in result to fetch. Rows are numbered from 0 upwards. If
omitted, next row is fetched.

{field} A string representing the name of the field (column) to fetch,
otherwise an int representing the field number to fetch. Fields are numbered
from 0 upwards.

Boolean is returned as "t" or "f". All other types, including arrays are
returned as strings formatted in the same default PostgreSQL manner that you
would see in the psql program. Database NULL values are returned as NULL.

FALSE is returned if {row} exceeds the number of rows in the set, or on any
other error.

<?php >
  $db = pg_connect("dbname=users user=me") || die();

  echo "First field in the second row is: ", $val, "\n";
