db2_commit -- Commits a transaction

  bool db2_commit(resource connection)~

begins a new transaction. PHP applications normally default to AUTOCOMMIT
mode, so |db2_commit| is not necessary unless AUTOCOMMIT has been turned off
for the connection resource.

{connection} A valid database connection resource variable as returned from
|db2_connect| or |db2_pconnect|.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

|db2_autocommit| |db2_rollback|
