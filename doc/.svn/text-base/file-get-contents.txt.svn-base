file_get_contents -- Reads entire file into a string

  string file_get_contents(string filename [, bool use_include_path [, resource context [, int offset [, int maxlen]]]])~

This function is similar to |file|, except that |file_get_contents| returns
the file in a string, starting at the specified {offset} up to {maxlen} bytes.
On failure, |file_get_contents| will return FALSE.

|file_get_contents| is the preferred way to read the contents of a file into a
string. It will use memory mapping techniques if supported by your OS to
enhance performance.

If you're opening a URI with special characters, such as spaces, you need to
encode the URI with |urlencode|.

{filename} Name of the file to read.

{use_include_path} As of PHP 5 the FILE_USE_INCLUDE_PATH can be used to
trigger include path search.

{context} A valid context resource created with |stream_context_create|. If
you don't need to use a custom context, you can skip this parameter by NULL.

{offset} The offset where the reading starts on the original stream.

Seeking ({offset}) is not supported with remote files. Attempting to seek on
non-local files may work with small offsets, but this is unpredictable because
it works on the buffered stream.

{maxlen} Maximum length of data read. The default is to read until end of file
is reached. Note that this parameter is applied to the stream processed by the
filters.

The function returns the read data or FALSE on failure.

An E_WARNING level error is generated if either {maxlength} is less than zero,
or if {offset} exceeds the length of the stream.

Get and output the source of the homepage of a website

<?php >
  $homepage = file_get_contents('http://www.example.com/');
  echo $homepage;
?>



Searching within the include_path

<?php >
  // <= PHP 5
  $file = file_get_contents('./people.txt', true);
  // > PHP 5
  $file = file_get_contents('./people.txt', FILE_USE_INCLUDE_PATH);
?>



Reading a section of a file

<?php >
  // Read 14 characters starting from the 21st character
  $section = file_get_contents('./people.txt', NULL, NULL, 20, 14);
  var_dump($section);
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  string(14) "lle Bjori Ro"

Using stream contexts

<?php >
  // Create a stream
  $opts = array(
    'http'=>array(
      'method'=>"GET",
      'header'=>"Accept-language: en\r\n" .
                "Cookie: foo=bar\r\n"
    )
  );
  
  $context = stream_context_create($opts);
  
  // Open the file using the HTTP headers set above
  $file = file_get_contents('http://www.example.com/', false, $context);
?>





Version Description 5.1.0 Added the {offset} and {maxlen} parameters. 5.0.0
Added context support.

This function is binary-safe.

A URL can be used as a filename with this function if the fopen wrappers have
been enabled. See |fopen| for more details on how to specify the filename. See
the for links to information about what abilities the various wrappers have,
notes on their usage, and information on any predefined variables they may
provide.

When using SSL, Microsoft IIS will violate the protocol by closing the
connection without sending a close_notify indicator. PHP will report this as
"SSL: Fatal Protocol Error" when you reach the end of the data. To work around
this, the value of error_reporting should be lowered to a level that does not
include warnings. PHP 4.3.7 and higher can detect buggy IIS server software
when you open the stream using the https:// wrapper and will suppress the
warning. When using |fsockopen| to create an ssl:// socket, the developer is
responsible for detecting and suppressing this warning.
