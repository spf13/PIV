COM -- COM class

The COM class allows you to instantiate an OLE compatible COM object and call
its methods and access its properties.

  com COM::COM(string module_name [, mixed server_name [, int codepage [, string typelib]]])~

COM class constructor. The parameters have the following meanings: module_name
Can be a ProgID, Class ID or Moniker that names the component to load.

A ProgID is typically the application or DLL name, followed by a period,
followed by the object name. e.g: Word.Application.

A Class ID is the UUID that uniquely identifies a given class.

A Moniker is a special form of naming, similar in concept to a URL scheme,
that identifies a resource and specifies how it should be loaded. As an
example, you could load up Word and get an object representing a word document
by specifying the full path to the word document as the module name, or you
can use LDAP: as a moniker to use the ADSI interface to LDAP.

server_name The name of the DCOM server on which the component should be
loaded and run. If NULL, the object is run using the default for the
application. The default is typically to run it on the local machine, although
the administrator might have configured the application to launch on a
different machine.

If you specify a non-NULL value for server, PHP will refuse to load the object
unless the configuration option is set to TRUE.

If {server_name} is an array, it should contain the following elements (case
sensitive!). Note that they are all optional (although you need to specify
both Username and Password together); if you omit the Server setting, the
default server will be used (as mentioned above), and the instantiation of the
object will not be affected by the directive. DCOM server name {server_name}
key type description Server string The name of the server. Username string The
username to connect as. Password string The password for {Username}. Flags
integer One or more of the following constants, logically OR'd together:
CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER, CLSCTX_INPROC_HANDLER, CLSCTX_LOCAL_SERVER,
CLSCTX_REMOTE_SERVER, CLSCTX_SERVER and CLSCTX_ALL. The default value if not
specified here is CLSCTX_SERVER if you also omit {Server}, or
CLSCTX_REMOTE_SERVER if you do specify a server. You should consult the
Microsoft documentation for CoCreateInstance for more information on the
meaning of these constants; you will typically never have to use them.

codepage Specifies the codepage that is used to convert strings to
unicode-strings and vice versa. The conversion is applied whenever a PHP
string is passed as a parameter or returned from a method of this COM object.
The code page is sticky in PHP 5, which means that it will propagate to
objects and variants returned from the object.

Possible values are CP_ACP (use system default ANSI code page - the default if
this parameter is omitted), CP_MACCP, CP_OEMCP, CP_SYMBOL, CP_THREAD_ACP (use
codepage/locale set for the current executing thread), CP_UTF7 and CP_UTF8.
You may also use the number for a given codepage; consult the Microsoft
documentation for more details on codepages and their numeric values.

The returned object is an overloaded object, which means that PHP does not see
any fixed methods as it does with regular classes; instead, any property or
method accesses are passed through to COM.

Starting with PHP 5, PHP will automatically detect methods that accept
parameters by reference, and will automatically convert regular PHP variables
to a form that can be passed by reference. This means that you can call the
method very naturally; you needn't go to any extra effort in your code.

In PHP 4, to pass parameters by reference you need to create an instance of
the class to wrap the byref parameters.

In PHP versions prior to 5, a number of not very pleasant hacks meant that the
following method names were not passed through to COM and were handled
directly by PHP. PHP 5 eliminates these things; read the details below to
determine how to fix your scripts. These magic method names are case
insensitive.

  void COM::AddRef(string module_name [, mixed server_name [, int codepage [, string typelib]]])~

Artificially adds a reference count to the COM object.

You should never need to use this method. It exists as a logical complement to
the Release() method below.

  void COM::Release(string module_name [, mixed server_name [, int codepage [, string typelib]]])~

Artificially removes a reference count from the COM object.

You should never need to use this method. Its existence in PHP is a bug
designed to work around a bug that keeps COM objects running longer than they
should.

These pseudo methods are only available if |com_isenum| returns TRUE, in which
case, they hide any methods with the same names that might otherwise be
provided by the COM object. These methods have all been eliminated in PHP 5,
and you should use instead.

  variant COM::All(string module_name [, mixed server_name [, int codepage [, string typelib]]])~

Returns a variant representing a SafeArray that has 10 elements; each element
will be an empty/null variant. This function was supposed to return an array
containing all the elements from the iterator, but was never completed. Do not
use.

  variant COM::Next(string module_name [, mixed server_name [, int codepage [, string typelib]]])~

Returns a variant representing the next element available from the iterator,
or FALSE when there are no more elements.

  variant COM::Prev(string module_name [, mixed server_name [, int codepage [, string typelib]]])~

Returns a variant representing the previous element available from the
iterator, or FALSE when there are no more elements.

  void COM::Reset(string module_name [, mixed server_name [, int codepage [, string typelib]]])~

Rewinds the iterator back to the start.

COM example (1)

<?php >
  // starting word
  $word = new COM("word.application") or die("Unable to instantiate Word");
  echo "Loaded Word, version {$word->Version}\n";
  
  //bring it to front
  $word->Visible = 1;
  
  //open an empty document
  $word->Documents->Add();
  
  //do some weird stuff
  $word->Selection->TypeText("This is a test...");
  $word->Documents[1]->SaveAs("Useless test.doc");
  
  //closing word
  $word->Quit();
  
  //free the object
  $word = null;
?>





COM example (2)

<?php >
  $conn = new COM("ADODB.Connection") or die("Cannot start ADO");
  $conn->Open("Provider=SQLOLEDB; Data Source=localhost;
  Initial Catalog=database; User ID=user; Password=password");
  
  $rs = $conn->Execute("SELECT * FROM sometable");    // Recordset
  
  $num_columns = $rs->Fields->Count();
  echo $num_columns . "\n";
  
  for ($i=0; $i < $num_columns; $i++) {
      $fld[$i] = $rs->Fields($i);
  }
  
  $rowcount = 0;
  while (!$rs->EOF) {
      for ($i=0; $i < $num_columns; $i++) {
          echo $fld[$i]->value . "\t";
      }
      echo "\n";
      $rowcount++;            // increments rowcount
      $rs->MoveNext();
  }
  
  $rs->Close();
  $conn->Close();
  
  $rs = null;
  $conn = null;
?>
