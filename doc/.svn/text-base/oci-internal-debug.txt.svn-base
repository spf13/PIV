oci_internal_debug -- Enables or disables internal debug output

  void oci_internal_debug(bool onoff)~

Enables or disables internal debug output.

{onoff} Set this to FALSE to turn debug output off or TRUE to turn it on.

No value is returned.

In PHP versions before 5.0.0 you must use |ociinternaldebug| instead. This
name still can be used, it was left as alias of |oci_internal_debug| for
downwards compatability. This, however, is deprecated and not recommended.
