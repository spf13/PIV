strtok -- Tokenize string

  string strtok(string str, string token)~

  string strtok(string str, string token, string token)~

|strtok| splits a string ({str}) into smaller strings (tokens), with each
token being delimited by any character from {token}. That is, if you have a
string like "This is an example string" you could tokenize this string into
its individual words by using the space character as the token.

Note that only the first call to strtok uses the string argument. Every
subsequent call to strtok only needs the token to use, as it keeps track of
where it is in the current string. To start over, or to tokenize a new string
you simply call strtok with the string argument again to initialize it. Note
that you may put multiple tokens in the token parameter. The string will be
tokenized when any one of the characters in the argument are found.

{str} The string being split up into smaller strings (tokens).

{token} The delimiter used when splitting up {str}.

A string token.

|strtok| example

<?php >
  $string = "This is\tan example\nstring";
  /* Use tab and newline as tokenizing characters as well  */
  $tok = strtok($string, " \n\t");
  
  while ($tok !== false) {
      echo "Word=$tok<br />";
      $tok = strtok(" \n\t");
  }
?>





The behavior when an empty part was found changed with PHP 4.1.0. The old
behavior returned an empty string, while the new, correct, behavior simply
skips the part of the string:

Old |strtok| behavior

<?php >
  $first_token  = strtok('/something', '/');
  $second_token = strtok('/');
  var_dump($first_token, $second_token);
?>

The above example will output:

  string(0) ""
      string(9) "something"

New |strtok| behavior

<?php >
  $first_token  = strtok('/something', '/');
  $second_token = strtok('/');
  var_dump($first_token, $second_token);
?>

The above example will output:

  string(9) "something"
      bool(false)



This function may return Boolean FALSE, but may also return a non-Boolean
value which evaluates to FALSE, such as 0 or "". Please read the section on
Booleans for more information. Use the === operator for testing the return
value of this function.
