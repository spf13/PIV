serialize -- Generates a storable representation of a value

  string serialize(mixed value)~

Generates a storable representation of a value

This is useful for storing or passing PHP values around without losing their
type and structure.

To make the serialized string into a PHP value again, use |unserialize|.

{value} The value to be serialized. |serialize| handles all types, except the
resource-type. You can even |serialize| arrays that contain references to
itself. Circular references inside the array/object you are serializing will
also be stored. Any other reference will be lost.

When serializing objects, PHP will attempt to call the member function __sleep
prior to serialization. This is to allow the object to do any last minute
clean-up, etc. prior to being serialized. Likewise, when the object is
restored using |unserialize| the __wakeup member function is called.

Object's private members have the class name prepended to the member name;
protected members have a '*' prepended to the member name. These prepended
values have null bytes on either side.

Returns a string containing a byte-stream representation of {value} that can
be stored anywhere.

|serialize| example

<?php >
  // $session_data contains a multi-dimensional array with session
  // information for the current user.  We use serialize() to store
  // it in a database at the end of the request.
  
  $conn = odbc_connect("webdb", "php", "chicken");
  $stmt = odbc_prepare($conn,
        "UPDATE sessions SET data = ? WHERE id = ?");
  $sqldata = array (serialize($session_data), $_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_USER']);
  if (!odbc_execute($stmt, $sqldata)) {
      $stmt = odbc_prepare($conn,
       "INSERT INTO sessions (id, data) VALUES(?, ?)");
      if (!odbc_execute($stmt, $sqldata)) {
          /* Something went wrong.. */
      }
  }
?>





Version Description 4.0.7 The object serialization process was fixed.

Note that many built-in PHP objects cannot be serialized. However, those with
this ability either implement the Serializable interface or the magic __sleep
and __wakeup methods. If an internal class does not fulfill any of those
requirements, it cannot reliably be serialized.

There are some historical exceptions to the above rule, where some internal
objects could be serialized without implementing the interface or exposing the
methods. Notably, the ArrayObject prior to PHP 5.2.0.
