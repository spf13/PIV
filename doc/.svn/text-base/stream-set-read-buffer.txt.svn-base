stream_set_read_buffer -- Set read file buffering on the given stream

  int stream_set_read_buffer(resource stream, int buffer)~

Sets the read buffer. It's the equivalent of |stream_set_write_buffer|, but
for read operations.

The file pointer.

The number of bytes to buffer. If {buffer} is 0 then read operations are
unbuffered. This ensures that all reads with |fread| are completed before
other processes are allowed to write to that output stream.

Returns 0 on success, or EOF if the request cannot be honored.
