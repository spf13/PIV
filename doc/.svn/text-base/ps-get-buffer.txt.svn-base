ps_get_buffer -- Fetches the full buffer containig the generated PS data

  string ps_get_buffer(resource psdoc)~

This function is not implemented yet. It will always return an empty string.
The idea for a later implementation is to write the contents of the postscript
file into an internal buffer if in memory creation is requested, and retrieve
the buffer content with this function. Currently, documents created in memory
are send to the browser without buffering.

This function is currently not documented; only its argument list is
available.

{psdoc} Resource identifier of the postscript file as returned by |ps_new|.

|ps_open_file|
