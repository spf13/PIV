fgetc -- Gets character from file pointer

  string fgetc(resource handle)~

Gets a character from the given file pointer.

by {handle}. Returns FALSE on EOF.

value which evaluates to FALSE, such as 0 or "". Please read the section on
Booleans for more information. Use the === operator for testing the return
value of this function.

      echo "$char\n";
