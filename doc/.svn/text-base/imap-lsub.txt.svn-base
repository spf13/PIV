  array imap_lsub(resource imap_stream, string ref, string pattern)~

Gets an array of all the mailboxes that you have subscribed.

{ imap_stream}An IMAP stream returned by |imap_open|.

{ref} {ref} should normally be just the server specification as described in
|imap_open|

{pattern} Specifies where in the mailbox hierarchy to start searching.

There are two special characters you can pass as part of the {pattern}: "*"
and "&#37;". "*" means to return all mailboxes. If you pass {pattern} as "*",
you will get a list of the entire mailbox hierarchy. "&#37;" means to return
the current level only. "&#37;" as the {pattern} parameter will return only
the top level mailboxes; "~/mail/&#37;" on UW_IMAPD will return every mailbox
in the ~/mail directory, but none in subfolders of that directory.

Returns an array of all the subscribed mailboxes.
