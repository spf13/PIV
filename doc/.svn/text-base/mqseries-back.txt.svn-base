mqseries_back -- MQSeries MQBACK

  void mqseries_back(resource hconn, resource compCode, resource reason)~

The |mqseries_back| (MQBACK) call indicates to the queue manager that all the
message gets and puts that have occurred since the last syncpoint are to be
backed out. Messages put as part of a unit of work are deleted; messages
retrieved as part of a unit of work are reinstated on the queue.

Using |mqseries_back| only works in conjunction with |mqseries_begin| and only
function when connecting directly to a Queueu manager. Not via the mqclient
interface.

{hConn} Connection handle.

This handle represents the connection to the queue manager.

{compCode} Completion code.

{reason} Reason code qualifying the compCode.

No value is returned.

|mqseries_back| example

<?php >
      mqseries_back($conn, $comp_code, $reason);
  
      if ($comp_code !== MQSERIES_MQCC_OK) {
          printf("CompCode:%d Reason:%d Text:%s<br>\n", $comp_code, $reason, mqseries_strerror($reason));
      }
?>





|mqseries_back| will not function when using MQSeries Client to connect to a
Queueu Manager.
