array_diff_uassoc -- Computes the difference of arrays with additional index
check which is performed by a user supplied callback function

  array array_diff_uassoc(array array1, array array2 [, array ..., callback key_compare_func])~

Compares {array1} against {array2} and returns the difference. Unlike
|array_diff| the array keys are used in the comparison.

Unlike |array_diff_assoc| an user supplied callback function is used for the
indices comparison, not internal function.

{array1} The array to compare from

{array2} An array to compare against

{...} More arrays to compare against

{key_compare_func} callback function to use. The callback function must return
an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if the first argument is
considered to be respectively less than, equal to, or greater than the second.

Returns an array containing all the entries from {array1} that are not present
in any of the other arrays.

|array_diff_uassoc| example The "a" => "green" pair is present in both arrays
and thus it is not in the output from the function. Unlike this, the pair 0 =>
"red" is in the output because in the second argument "red" has key which is
1.

<?php >
  function key_compare_func($a, $b)
  {
      if ($a === $b) {
          return 0;
      }
      return ($a > $b)? 1:-1;
  }
  
  $array1 = array("a" => "green", "b" => "brown", "c" => "blue", "red");
  $array2 = array("a" => "green", "yellow", "red");
  $result = array_diff_uassoc($array1, $array2, "key_compare_func");
  print_r($result);
?>

The above example will output:

  Array
  (
      [b] => brown
      [c] => blue
      [0] => red
  )

The equality of 2 indices is checked by the user supplied callback function.





This function only checks one dimension of a n-dimensional array. Of course
you can check deeper dimensions by using, for example,
array_diff_uassoc($array1[0], $array2[0], "key_compare_func");.
