iconv -- Convert string to requested character encoding

  string iconv(string in_charset, string out_charset, string str)~

Performs a character set conversion on the string {str} from {in_charset} to
{out_charset}.

{in_charset} The input charset.

{out_charset} The output charset.

If you append the string //TRANSLIT to {out_charset} transliteration is
activated. This means that when a character can't be represented in the target
charset, it can be approximated through one or several similarly looking
characters. If you append the string //IGNORE, characters that cannot be
represented in the target charset are silently discarded. Otherwise, {str} is
cut from the first illegal character and an E_NOTICE is generated.

{str} The string to be converted.

Returns the converted string or FALSE on failure.

|iconv| example

<?php >
  $text = "This is the Euro symbol '€'.";
  
  echo 'Original : ', $text, PHP_EOL;
  echo 'TRANSLIT : ', iconv("UTF-8", "ISO-8859-1//TRANSLIT", $text), PHP_EOL;
  echo 'IGNORE   : ', iconv("UTF-8", "ISO-8859-1//IGNORE", $text), PHP_EOL;
  echo 'Plain    : ', iconv("UTF-8", "ISO-8859-1", $text), PHP_EOL;
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  Original : This is the Euro symbol '€'.
  TRANSLIT : This is the Euro symbol 'EUR'.
  IGNORE   : This is the Euro symbol ''.
  Plain    :
  Notice: iconv(): Detected an illegal character in input string in .\iconv-example.php on line 7
  This is the Euro symbol '
