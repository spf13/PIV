posix_times -- Get process times

  array posix_times()~

Gets information about the current CPU usage.

Returns a hash of strings with information about the current process CPU
usage. The indices of the hash are: ticks - the number of clock ticks that
have elapsed since reboot.

utime - user time used by the current process.

stime - system time used by the current process.

cutime - user time used by current process and children.

cstime - system time used by current process and children.

This function isn't reliable to use, it may return negative values for high
times.

Example use of |posix_times|

<?php >
  $times = posix_times();
  
  print_r($times);
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  Array
  (
      [ticks] => 25814410
      [utime] => 1
      [stime] => 1
      [cutime] => 0
      [cstime] => 0
  )
