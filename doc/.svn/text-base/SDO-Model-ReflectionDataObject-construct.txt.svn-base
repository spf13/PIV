This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

Construct an SDO_Model_ReflectionDataObject to reflect on an SDO_DataObject.
Reflecting on an SDO_DataObject gives access to information about its model.
The model contains information such as the data object's type, and whether
that type is sequenced (preserves ordering across properties) or open (each
instance can have its model extended). The model also holds information about
the data object's properties, any default values they may have, and so on.

{data_object} The SDO_DataObject being reflected upon.

None.
