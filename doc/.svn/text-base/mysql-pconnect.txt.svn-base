mysql_pconnect -- Open a persistent connection to a MySQL server

  resource mysql_pconnect([string server [, string username [, string password [, int client_flags]]]])~

Establishes a persistent connection to a MySQL server.

|mysql_pconnect| acts very much like |mysql_connect| with two major
differences.

First, when connecting, the function would first try to find a (persistent)
link that's already open with the same host, username and password. If one is
found, an identifier for it will be returned instead of opening a new
connection.

Second, the connection to the SQL server will not be closed when the execution
of the script ends. Instead, the link will remain open for future use
(|mysql_close| will not close links established by |mysql_pconnect|).

This type of link is therefore called 'persistent'.

{server} The MySQL server. It can also include a port number. e.g.
"hostname:port" or a path to a local socket e.g. ":/path/to/socket" for the
localhost.

If the PHP directive mysql.default_host is undefined (default), then the
default value is 'localhost:3306'

{username} The username. Default value is the name of the user that owns the
server process.

{password} The password. Default value is an empty password.

{client_flags} The {client_flags} parameter can be a combination of the
following constants: 128 (enable LOAD DATA LOCAL handling), MYSQL_CLIENT_SSL,
MYSQL_CLIENT_COMPRESS, MYSQL_CLIENT_IGNORE_SPACE or MYSQL_CLIENT_INTERACTIVE.

Returns a MySQL persistent link identifier on success, or FALSE on failure.

Version Description 4.3.0 Added the {client_flags} parameter.

Note, that these kind of links only work if you are using a module version of
PHP. See the Persistent Database Connections section for more information.

Using persistent connections can require a bit of tuning of your Apache and
MySQL configurations to ensure that you do not exceed the number of
connections allowed by MySQL.

You can suppress the error message on failure by prepending a @ to the
function name.
