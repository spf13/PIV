dirname -- Returns parent directory's path

  string dirname(string path)~

Given a string containing the path of a file or directory, this function will
return the parent directory's path.

{path} A path.

On Windows, both slash (/) and backslash (\) are used as directory separator
character. In other environments, it is the forward slash (/).

Returns the path of the parent directory. If there are no slashes in {path}, a
dot ('.') is returned, indicating the current directory. Otherwise, the
returned string is {path} with any trailing /component removed.

Version Description 5.0.0 |dirname| is now binary safe 4.0.3 |dirname| was
fixed to be POSIX-compliant.

|dirname| example

<?php >
  echo "1) " . dirname("/etc/passwd") . PHP_EOL; // 1) /etc
  echo "2) " . dirname("/etc/") . PHP_EOL; // 2) / (or \ on Windows)
  echo "3) " . dirname("."); // 3) .
?>





|dirname| operates naively on the input string, and is not aware of the actual
filesystem, or path components such as "..".

|dirname| is locale aware, so for it to see the correct directory name with
multibyte character paths, the matching locale must be set using the
|setlocale| function.

Since PHP 4.3.0, you will often get a slash or a dot back from |dirname| in
situations where the older functionality would have given you the empty
string.

Check the following change example:

<?php >
  //before PHP 4.3.0
  dirname('c:/'); // returned '.'
  
  //after PHP 4.3.0
  dirname('c:/x'); // returns 'c:\'
  dirname('c:/Temp/x'); // returns 'c:/Temp'
  dirname('/x'); // returns '\'
?>

|basename| |pathinfo| |realpath|
