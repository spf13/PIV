ncurses_init_color -- Define a terminal color

  int ncurses_init_color(int color, int r, int g, int b)~

Defines or redefines the given color. When this function is called, all
occurrences of the given color on the screen, if any, immediately change to
the new definition.

Color capabilities must be supported by the terminal and initialized using
|ncurses_start_color| prior to calling this function. In addition, the
terminal must have color changing capabilities; use |ncurses_can_change_color|
to check for this.

{color} The identification number of the color to redefine. It may be one of
the default color constants.

{r} A color value, between 0 and 1000, for the red component.

{g} A color value, between 0 and 1000, for the green component.

{b} A color value, between 0 and 1000, for the blue component.

Returns -1 if the function was successful, and 0 if ncurses or terminal color
capabilities have not been initialized or the terminal does not have color
changing capabilities.
