wincache_ucache_inc -- Increments the value associated with the key

  mixed wincache_ucache_inc(string key [, int inc_by [, bool success]])~

Increments the value associated with the {key} by 1 or as specified by
{inc_by}.

{key} The {key} that was used to store the variable in the cache. {key} is
case sensitive.

{inc_by} The value by which the variable associated with the {key} will get
incremented. If the argument is a floating point number it will be truncated
to nearest integer. The variable associated with the {key} should be of type
long, otherwise the function fails and returns FALSE.

{success} Will be set to TRUE on success and FALSE on failure.

Returns the incremented value on success and FALSE on failure.
