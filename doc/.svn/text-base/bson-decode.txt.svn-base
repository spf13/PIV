bson_decode -- Deserializes a BSON object into a PHP array

  array bson_decode(string bson)~

This function is very beta and entirely useless for 99% of users. It is only
useful if you're doing something weird, such as writing your own driver on top
of the PHP driver.

{bson} The BSON to be deserialized.

Returns the deserialized BSON object.
