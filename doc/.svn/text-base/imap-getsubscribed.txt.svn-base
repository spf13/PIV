imap_getsubscribed -- List all the subscribed mailboxes

  array imap_getsubscribed(resource imap_stream, string ref, string pattern)~

Gets information about the subscribed mailboxes.

Identical to |imap_getmailboxes|, except that it only returns mailboxes that
the user is subscribed to.

{ imap_stream}An IMAP stream returned by |imap_open|.

{ref} {ref} should normally be just the server specification as described in
|imap_open|

{pattern} Specifies where in the mailbox hierarchy to start searching.

There are two special characters you can pass as part of the {pattern}: "*"
and "&#37;". "*" means to return all mailboxes. If you pass {pattern} as "*",
you will get a list of the entire mailbox hierarchy. "&#37;" means to return
the current level only. "&#37;" as the {pattern} parameter will return only
the top level mailboxes; "~/mail/&#37;" on UW_IMAPD will return every mailbox
in the ~/mail directory, but none in subfolders of that directory.

Returns an array of objects containing mailbox information. Each object has
the attributes {name}, specifying the full name of the mailbox; {delimiter},
which is the hierarchy delimiter for the part of the hierarchy this mailbox is
in; and {attributes}. {Attributes} is a bitmask that can be tested against:
LATT_NOINFERIORS - This mailbox has no "children" (there are no mailboxes
below this one).

LATT_NOSELECT - This is only a container, not a mailbox - you cannot open it.

LATT_MARKED - This mailbox is marked. Only used by UW-IMAPD.

LATT_UNMARKED - This mailbox is not marked. Only used by UW-IMAPD.
