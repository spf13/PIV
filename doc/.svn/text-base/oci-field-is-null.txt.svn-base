oci_field_is_null -- Checks if the field is NULL

  bool oci_field_is_null(resource statement, mixed field)~

Checks if the given {field} from the {statement} is NULL.

{statement} A valid OCI statement identifier.

{field} Can be a field's index or a field's name (uppercased).

Returns TRUE if {field} is NULL, FALSE otherwise.

In PHP versions before 5.0.0 you must use |ocicolumnisnull| instead. This name
still can be used, it was left as alias of |oci_field_is_null| for downwards
compatability. This, however, is deprecated and not recommended.
