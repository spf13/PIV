sybase_fetch_array -- Fetch row as array

  array sybase_fetch_array(resource result)~

|sybase_fetch_array| is an extended version of |sybase_fetch_row|. In addition
to storing the data in the numeric indices of the result array, it also stores
the data in associative indices, using the field names as keys.

An important thing to note is that using |sybase_fetch_array| is NOT
significantly slower than using |sybase_fetch_row|, while it provides a
significant added value.

{result}

Returns an array that corresponds to the fetched row, or FALSE if there are no
more rows.

When selecting fields with identical names (for instance, in a join), the
associative indices will have a sequential number prepended. See the example
for details.

Identical fieldnames

<?php >
  $dbh = sybase_connect('SYBASE', '', '');
  $q = sybase_query('SELECT * FROM p, a WHERE p.person_id= a.person_id');
  var_dump(sybase_fetch_array($q));
  sybase_close($dbh);
?>

The above example would produce the following output (assuming the two tables
only have each one column called "person_id"):

  array(4) {
    [0]=>
    int(1)
    ["person_id"]=>
    int(1)
    [1]=>
    int(1)
    ["person_id1"]=>
    int(1)
  }
