radius_demangle_mppe_key -- Derives mppe-keys from mangled data

  string radius_demangle_mppe_key(resource radius_handle, string mangled)~

When using MPPE with MS-CHAPv2, the send- and recv-keys are mangled (see RFC
2548), however this function is useless, because I don't think that there is
or will be a PPTP-MPPE implementation in PHP.

Returns the demangled string, or FALSE on error.
