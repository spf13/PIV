msql_fetch_array -- Fetch row as array

  array msql_fetch_array(resource result [, int result_type])~

|msql_fetch_array| is an extended version of |msql_fetch_row|. In addition to
storing the data in the numeric indices of the result array, it also stores
the data in associative indices, using the field names as keys.

An important thing to note is that using |msql_fetch_array| is NOT
significantly slower than using |msql_fetch_row|, while it provides a
significant added value.

{ result}The result resource that is being evaluated. This result comes from a
call to |msql_query|.

{result_type} A constant that can take the following values: MSQL_ASSOC,
MSQL_NUM, and MSQL_BOTH with MSQL_BOTH being the default.

Returns an array that corresponds to the fetched row, or FALSE if there are no
more rows.

|msql_fetch_array| example

<?php >
  $con = msql_connect();
  if (!$con) {
      die('Server connection problem: ' . msql_error());
  }
  
  if (!msql_select_db('test', $con)) {
      die('Database connection problem: ' . msql_error());
  }
  
  $result = msql_query('SELECT id, name FROM people', $con);
  if (!$result) {
      die('Query execution problem: ' . msql_error());
  }
  
  while ($row = msql_fetch_array($result, MSQL_ASSOC)) {
      echo $row['id'] . ': ' . $row['name'] . "\n";
  }
  
  msql_free_result($result);
?>





Version Description 4.3.11 and 5.0.4 A bug was fixed when retrieving data from
columns containing NULL values. Such columns were not placed into the
resulting array.
