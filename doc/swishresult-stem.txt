SwishResult->stem -- Stems the given word

  array SwishResult->stem(string word)~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

Stems the word based on the fuzzy mode used during indexing. Each result
object is linked with its index, so the results are based on this index.

{word} The word to stem.

Returns array containing the stemmed word variants (usually just one).

Throws SwishException on error.

Basic |SwishResult->stem| example

<?php >
  try {
  
      $swish = new Swish("ext/swish/tests/index.swish-e");
      $results = $swish->query("testing OR others");
  
      if ($result = $results->nextResult()) {
          var_dump($result->stem("testing")); //the results fully depend on the stemmer used in the index
          var_dump($result->stem("others"));
      }
  
  } catch (SwishException $e) {
      echo "Error: ", $e->getMessage(), "\n";
  }
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  array(1) {
    [0]=>
    string(4) "test"
  }
  array(1) {
    [0]=>
    string(5) "other"
  }
