DomXsltStylesheet->result_dump_mem -- Dumps the result from a
XSLT-Transformation back into a string

  string result_dump_mem(DomDocument xmldoc)~

Since always returns a well-formed XML DomDocument, no matter what output
method was declared in <xsl:output> and similar attributes/elements, it's of
not much use, if you want to output HTML 4 or text data.

This function on the contrary honors <xsl:output method="html|text"> and other
output control directives. See the example for instruction on how to use it.

Outputting the result of a XSLT transformation

<?php >
  $filename = "stylesheet.xsl";
  $xmldoc = domxml_open_file("data.xml");
  $xsldoc = domxml_xslt_stylesheet_file($filename);
  $result =  $xsldoc->process($xmldoc);
  echo $xsldoc->result_dump_mem($result);     
?>
