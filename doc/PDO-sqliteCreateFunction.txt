PDO::sqliteCreateFunction -- Registers a User Defined Function for use in SQL
statements

  bool sqliteCreateFunction(string function_name, callback callback [, int num_args])~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

This method allows you to register a PHP function with SQLite as an UDF (User
Defined Function), so that it can be called from within your SQL statements.

The UDF can be used in any SQL statement that can call functions, such as
SELECT and UPDATE statements and also in triggers.

{function_name} The name of the function used in SQL statements.

{callback} Callback function to handle the defined SQL function.

Callback functions should return a type understood by SQLite (i.e. scalar
type).

{num_args} Hint to the SQLite parser if the callback function accepts a
predetermined number of arguments.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

|PDO::sqliteCreateFunction| example

<?php >
  function md5_and_reverse($string) 
  {
      return strrev(md5($string));
  }
  
  $db = new PDO('sqlite:sqlitedb');
  $db->sqliteCreateFunction('md5rev', 'md5_and_reverse', 1);
  $rows = $db->query('SELECT md5rev(filename) FROM files')->fetchAll();
?>





In this example, we have a function that calculates the md5 sum of a string,
and then reverses it. When the SQL statement executes, it returns the value of
the filename transformed by our function. The data returned in {$rows}
contains the processed result.

The beauty of this technique is that you do not need to process the result
using a foreach loop after you have queried for the data.

You can use and to override SQLite native SQL functions.

This method is not available with the SQLite2 driver. Use the old style sqlite
API for that instead.
