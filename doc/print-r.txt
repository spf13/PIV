print_r -- Prints human-readable information about a variable

  mixed print_r(mixed expression [, bool return])~

|print_r| displays information about a variable in a way that's readable by
humans.

|print_r|, |var_dump| and |var_export| will also show protected and private
properties of objects with PHP 5. Static class members will not be shown.

Remember that |print_r| will move the array pointer to the end. Use |reset| to
bring it back to beginning.

{expression} The expression to be printed.

{return} If you would like to capture the output of |print_r|, use the
{return} parameter. If this parameter is set to TRUE, |print_r| will return
its output, instead of printing it (which it does by default).

If given a string, integer or float, the value itself will be printed. If
given an array, values will be presented in a format that shows keys and
elements. Similar notation is used for objects.

This function uses internal output buffering with this parameter so it can not
be used inside an |ob_start| callback function.

Version Description 4.3.0 The {return} parameter was added. If you need to
capture the output of |print_r| with an older version of PHP prior, use the
output-control functions. 4.0.4 Prior to PHP 4.0.4, |print_r| will continue
forever if given an array or object that contains a direct or indirect
reference to itself. An example is print_r($GLOBALS) because $GLOBALS is
itself a global variable that contains a reference to itself.

|print_r| example

  <pre>
<?php >
  $a = array ('a' => 'apple', 'b' => 'banana', 'c' => array ('x', 'y', 'z'));
  print_r ($a);
?>
  </pre>

The above example will output:

  <pre>
  Array
  (
      [a] => apple
      [b] => banana
      [c] => Array
          (
              [0] => x
              [1] => y
              [2] => z
          )
  )
  </pre>



{return} parameter example

<?php >
  $b = array ('m' => 'monkey', 'foo' => 'bar', 'x' => array ('x', 'y', 'z'));
  $results = print_r($b, true); // $results now contains output from print_r
?>
