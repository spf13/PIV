radius_config -- Causes the library to read the given configuration file

  bool radius_config(resource radius_handle, string file)~

Before issuing any Radius requests, the library must be made aware of the
servers it can contact. The easiest way to configure the library is to call
|radius_config|. |radius_config| causes the library to read a configuration
file whose format is described in radius.conf.

{radius_handle}

{file} The pathname of the configuration file is passed as the file argument
to |radius_config|. The library can also be configured programmatically by
calls to |radius_add_server|.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

|radius_add_server|
