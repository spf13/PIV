mb_detect_order -- Set/Get character encoding detection order

  mixed mb_detect_order([mixed encoding_list])~

Sets the automatic character encoding detection order to {encoding_list}.

{encoding_list} {encoding_list} is an array or comma separated list of
character encoding. ("auto" is expanded to "ASCII, JIS, UTF-8, EUC-JP, SJIS")

If {encoding_list} is omitted, it returns the current character encoding
detection order as array.

This setting affects |mb_detect_encoding| and |mb_send_mail|.

mbstring currently implements the following encoding detection filters. If
there is an invalid byte sequence for the following encodings, encoding
detection will fail.

UTF-8, UTF-7, ASCII, EUC-JP,SJIS, eucJP-win, SJIS-win, JIS, ISO-2022-JP

For ISO-8859-*, mbstring always detects as ISO-8859-*.

For UTF-16, UTF-32, UCS2 and UCS4, encoding detection will fail always.

Useless detect order example

  ; Always detect as ISO-8859-1
  detect_order = ISO-8859-1, UTF-8
  
  ; Always detect as UTF-8, since ASCII/UTF-7 values are 
  ; valid for UTF-8
  detect_order = UTF-8, ASCII, UTF-7





Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
