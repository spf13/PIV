phpinfo -- Outputs lots of PHP information

  bool phpinfo([int what])~

Outputs a large amount of information about the current state of PHP. This
includes information about PHP compilation options and extensions, the PHP
version, server information and environment (if compiled as a module), the
PHP environment, OS version information, paths, master and local values of
configuration options, HTTP headers, and the PHP License.

Because every system is setup differently, |phpinfo| is commonly used to check
configuration settings and for available predefined variables on a given
system. Also, |phpinfo| is a valuable debugging tool as it contains all EGPCS
(Environment, GET, POST, Cookie, Server) data.

The output may be customized by passing one or more of the following constants
bitwise values summed together in the optional {what} parameter. One can also
combine the respective constants or bitwise values together with the or
operator.

|phpinfo| options Name (constant) Value Description INFO_GENERAL 1 The
configuration line, php.ini location, build date, Web Server, System and
more. INFO_CREDITS 2 PHP Credits. See also |phpcredits|. INFO_CONFIGURATION 4
Current Local and Master values for PHP directives. See also |ini_get|.
INFO_MODULES 8 Loaded modules and their respective settings. See also
|get_loaded_extensions|. INFO_ENVIRONMENT 16 Environment Variable information
that's also available in $_ENV. INFO_VARIABLES 32 Shows all predefined
variables from EGPCS (Environment, GET, POST, Cookie, Server). INFO_LICENSE
64 PHP License information. See also the license FAQ. INFO_ALL -1 Shows all
of the above. This is the default value.

|phpinfo| examples

<?php >
  // Show all information, defaults to INFO_ALL
  phpinfo();
  
  // Show just the module information.
  // phpinfo(8) yields identical results.
  phpinfo(INFO_MODULES);
?>

Parts of the information displayed are disabled when the expose_php
configuration setting is set to off. This includes the PHP and Zend logos,
and the credits.

|phpinfo| outputs plain text instead of HTML when using the CLI mode.

|get_loaded_extensions|, and the section on Predefined Variables.
