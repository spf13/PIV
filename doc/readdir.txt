readdir -- Read entry from directory handle

  string readdir([resource dir_handle])~

Returns the filename of the next file from the directory. The filenames are
returned in the order in which they are stored by the filesystem.

{dir_handle} The directory handle resource previously opened with |opendir|.
If the directory handle is not specified, the last link opened by |opendir| is
assumed.

Returns the filename on success, or FALSE on failure.

This function may return Boolean FALSE, but may also return a non-Boolean
value which evaluates to FALSE, such as 0 or "". Please read the section on
Booleans for more information. Use the === operator for testing the return
value of this function.

List all files in a directory Please note the fashion in which |readdir|'s
return value is checked in the examples below. We are explicitly testing
whether the return value is identical to (equal to and of the same type
as--see Comparison Operators for more information) FALSE since otherwise, any
directory entry whose name evaluates to FALSE will stop the loop (e.g. a
directory named "0").

<?php >
  // Note that !== did not exist until 4.0.0-RC2
  
  if ($handle = opendir('/path/to/files')) {
      echo "Directory handle: $handle\n";
      echo "Files:\n";
  
      /* This is the correct way to loop over the directory. */
      while (false !== ($file = readdir($handle))) {
          echo "$file\n";
      }
  
      /* This is the WRONG way to loop over the directory. */
      while ($file = readdir($handle)) {
          echo "$file\n";
      }
  
      closedir($handle);
  }
?>



List all files in the current directory and strip out . and ..

<?php >
  if ($handle = opendir('.')) {
      while (false !== ($file = readdir($handle))) {
          if ($file != "." &amp;& $file != "..") {
              echo "$file\n";
          }
      }
      closedir($handle);
  }
?>
