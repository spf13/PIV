preg_split -- Split string by a regular expression

  array preg_split(string pattern, string subject [, int limit [, int flags]])~

Split the given string by a regular expression.

{pattern} The pattern to search for, as a string.

{subject} The input string.

{limit} If specified, then only substrings up to {limit} are returned, and if
{limit} is -1, it actually means "no limit", which is useful for specifying
the {flags}.

{flags} {flags} can be any combination of the following flags (combined with
bitwise | operator): PREG_SPLIT_NO_EMPTY If this flag is set, only non-empty
pieces will be returned by |preg_split|.

PREG_SPLIT_DELIM_CAPTURE If this flag is set, parenthesized expression in the
delimiter pattern will be captured and returned as well.

PREG_SPLIT_OFFSET_CAPTURE If this flag is set, for every occurring match the
appendant string offset will also be returned. Note that this changes the
return value in an array where every element is an array consisting of the
matched string at offset 0 and its string offset into {subject} at offset 1.

Returns an array containing substrings of {subject} split along boundaries
matched by {pattern}.

Version Description 4.3.0 The PREG_SPLIT_OFFSET_CAPTURE was added 4.0.5 The
PREG_SPLIT_DELIM_CAPTURE was added 4.0.0 The {flags} parameter was added

|preg_split| example : Get the parts of a search string

<?php >
  // split the phrase by any number of commas or space characters,
  // which include " ", \r, \t, \n and \f
  $keywords = preg_split("/[\s,]+/", "hypertext language, programming");
?>





Splitting a string into component characters

<?php >
  $str = 'string';
  $chars = preg_split('//', $str, -1, PREG_SPLIT_NO_EMPTY);
  print_r($chars);
?>





Splitting a string into matches and their offsets

<?php >
  $str = 'hypertext language programming';
  $chars = preg_split('/ /', $str, -1, PREG_SPLIT_OFFSET_CAPTURE);
  print_r($chars);
?>

The above example will output:

  Array
  (
      [0] => Array
          (
              [0] => hypertext
              [1] => 0
          )
  
      [1] => Array
          (
              [0] => language
              [1] => 10
          )
  
      [2] => Array
          (
              [0] => programming
              [1] => 19
          )
  
  )



If you don't need the power of regular expressions, you can choose faster
(albeit simpler) alternatives like |explode| or |str_split|.
