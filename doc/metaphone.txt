metaphone -- Calculate the metaphone key of a string

  string metaphone(string str [, int phones])~

Calculates the metaphone key of {str}.

Similar to |soundex| metaphone creates the same key for similar sounding
words. It's more accurate than |soundex| as it knows the basic rules of
English pronunciation. The metaphone generated keys are of variable length.
