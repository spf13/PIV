mcrypt_generic -- This function encrypts data

  string mcrypt_generic(resource td, string data)~

This function encrypts data. The data is padded with "\0" to make sure the
length of the data is n * blocksize. This function returns the encrypted data.
Note that the length of the returned string can in fact be longer then the
input, due to the padding of the data.

If you want to store the encrypted data in a database make sure to store the
entire string as returned by mcrypt_generic, or the string will not entirely
decrypt properly. If your original string is 10 characters long and the block
size is 8 (use |mcrypt_enc_get_block_size| to determine the blocksize), you
would need at least 16 characters in your database field. Note the string
returned by |mdecrypt_generic| will be 16 characters as well...use rtrim($str,
"\0") to remove the padding.

If you are for example storing the data in a MySQL database remember that
varchar fields automatically have trailing spaces removed during insertion. As
encrypted data can end in a space (ASCII 32), the data will be damaged by this
removal. Store data in a tinyblob/tinytext (or larger) field instead.

{td} The encryption descriptor.

The encryption handle should always be initialized with |mcrypt_generic_init|
with a key and an IV before calling this function. Where the encryption is
done, you should free the encryption buffers by calling
|mcrypt_generic_deinit|. See |mcrypt_module_open| for an example.

{data} The data to encrypt.

Returns the encrypted data.

|mdecrypt_generic| |mcrypt_generic_init| |mcrypt_generic_deinit|
