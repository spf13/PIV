  bool ncurses_doupdate()~

This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, its name, and
surrounding documentation may change without notice in a future release of
PHP. This function should be used at your own risk.

Compares the virtual screen to the physical screen and updates the physical
screen. This way is more effective than using multiple refresh calls.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
