ifx_affected_rows -- Get number of rows affected by a query

  int ifx_affected_rows(resource result_id)~

Returns the number of rows affected by a query associated with {result_id}.

For inserts, updates and deletes the number is the real number (sqlerrd[2]) of
affected rows. For selects it is an estimate (sqlerrd[0]). Don't rely on it.
The database server can never return the actual number of rows that will be
returned by a SELECT because it has not even begun fetching them at this stage
(just after the "PREPARE" when the optimizer has determined the query plan).

Useful after |ifx_prepare| to limit queries to reasonable result sets.

{result_id} A valid result id returned by |ifx_query| or |ifx_prepare|.

Returns the number of rows as an integer.

Informix affected rows

<?php >
  $rid = ifx_prepare("select * from emp
                       where name like " . $name, $connid);
  if (! $rid) {
      /* ... error ... */
  }
  $rowcount = ifx_affected_rows($rid);
  if ($rowcount > 1000) {
      printf ("Too many rows in result set (%d)\n<br />", $rowcount);
      die ("Please restrict your query<br />\n");
  }
?>
