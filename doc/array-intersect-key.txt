array_intersect_key -- Computes the intersection of arrays using keys for
comparison

  array array_intersect_key(array array1, array array2 [, array ...])~

|array_intersect_key| returns an array containing all the values of {array1}
which have matching keys that are present in all the arguments.

{array1} The array with master keys to check.

{array2} An array to compare keys against.

{array} A variable list of arrays to compare.

Returns an associative array containing all the values of {array1} which have
matching keys that are present in all arguments.

|array_intersect_key| example

<?php >
  $array1 = array('blue'  => 1, 'red'  => 2, 'green'  => 3, 'purple' => 4);
  $array2 = array('green' => 5, 'blue' => 6, 'yellow' => 7, 'cyan'   => 8);
  
  var_dump(array_intersect_key($array1, $array2));
?>

The above example will output:

  array(2) {
    ["blue"]=>
    int(1)
    ["green"]=>
    int(3)
  }



In our example you see that only the keys 'blue' and 'green' are present in
both arrays and thus returned. Also notice that the values for the keys 'blue'
and 'green' differ between the two arrays. A match still occurs because only
the keys are checked. The values returned are those of {array1}.

The two keys from the key => value pairs are considered equal only if (string)
$key1 === (string) $key2 . In other words a strict type check is executed so
the string representation must be the same.
