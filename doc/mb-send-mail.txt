mb_send_mail -- Send encoded mail

  bool mb_send_mail(string to, string subject, string message [, string additional_headers [, string additional_parameter]])~

Sends email. Headers and messages are converted and encoded according to the
|mb_language| setting. It's a wrapper function for |mail|, so see also |mail|
for details.

{to} The mail addresses being sent to. Multiple recipients may be specified by
putting a comma between each address in {to}. This parameter is not
automatically encoded.

{subject} The subject of the mail.

{message} The message of the mail.

{additional_headers} {additional_headers} is inserted at the end of the
header. This is typically used to add extra headers. Multiple extra headers
are separated with a newline ("\n").

{additional_parameter} {additional_parameter} is a MTA command line parameter.
It is useful when setting the correct Return-Path header when using sendmail.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

Version Description 5.0.0 The Content-Type and Content-Transfer-Encoding
headers may be redefined as of PHP 5.0.0. Before this time, the values defined
by |mb_language| are always used.
